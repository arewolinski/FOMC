    This function determines the result of roll call on voting items. It does so by determining if 
    more than 7 "Yes" or "No" quotes have been said in the last 30 words, which is the indication I am
    using to determine if voting is taking place. Using other indications such as "Call the roll." are not reliable
    or consistent throughout transcript data. Relies on two helper methods â€“ one to count the instances
    of "Yes" and "No" and one to clean the data once we have identified the general area where the voting takes place.
