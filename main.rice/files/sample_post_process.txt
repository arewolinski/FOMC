CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN governor since youre standing move minutes last meeting MR LINDSEY yes move CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN without objection think youre familiar memorandum dated december 17th relates delegation responsibility decisions appeals freedom information act denials access committee records discussion issue questions somebody like move delegation responsibility MR LINDSEY move MR KELLEY second CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN without objection thank next item agenda interesting analysis dave stockton jack beebe relationship price stability economic performance believe initiated systemwide conference back turn floor gentlemen MR STOCKTON statementsee appendix MR BEEBE statementsee appendix CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN know weve done considerable work united states weed statistical effects im sure exist countries normal noise variables creates inverse correlation price change real GDP look implicit price deflator one hand gross domestic product constant dollars words independently estimated nominal GDP independently estimated set prices consider noise variables youre going end picking negative correlation united states think weve done enough area demonstrate even adjusting using industrial production versus price subject problem still creates robust relationship causation question big debate curious run grangercausation tests US data ive forgotten came MR STOCKTON work carried board weve done types statistical causality tests appear indication inflation causes productivity growth lions share negative correlation inflation productivity growth occurs contemporaneously evidence one say possible theres causal relationship certainly doesnt show strongly data correlation appears contemporaneous raising questions relationship CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN well doesnt necessarily follow causation must one direction both122193 concurrent relationship consistent unit labor costs pulled hence price level recall whether strictly statistical sense grangercausation results significant MR STOCKTON think answer yes significant running inflation productivity magnitude relationship looked relatively weak terms lagged part youre absolutely right terms contemporaneous relationship fact reflect causation running inflation productivity growth skeptic look evidence say doesnt prove course isnt going opposite direction well appears tantalizing correlation crosscountry studies time series data difficulty presenting skeptical audience think whatever regression result put table couldnt feel confident somebody else wouldnt come along another demonstrate particular regression wasnt fragile variety different minor modifications best CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN assume contemporaneous increase productivity order magnitude large far price inflation decline therefore couldnt explain words assume looking something argument productivity increases cause low inflation refuted level MR STOCKTON refuted level thats correct CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN questions MR PARRY question seems terms price distortion effects inflation pretty strong results effect productivity etc doesnt show strongly correct MR STOCKTON thats correct MR PARRY arent strong theoretical analytical reasons think negative effect fact quantitative results always strong focuses much data affected many things say establish something theoretically analyticallyand think thats doneits probable say respects results much stronger youve portrayed MR STOCKTON certainly case review literature examines effects inflation pricing system relative prices overwhelming majority studies come conclusion fact inflation introduce distortions price signaling think strong evidence inflation detrimental effects MR PARRY analytically conclusion inflation leads lot problems terms productivity probably also growth122193 3 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN yes think fairly widespread acceptance inflation rates 10 percent clearly disruptive probably large majority believe 5 percent upward crucial question happens academic evaluation inflation 5 percent less views start spread place MR PARRY think work indicated moderate rates inflation price distortions statistically significant CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN ask anybody ever tried isolate impacts trying subtract GDP costs fighting inflation MR STOCKTON hasnt done issue raised conference flaw sense studies weve done date relating inflation growth output something research CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN basically raise GDP finding something reservoir water tell GDP district columbia went water pollution question came retail activity everything else went one questions measured GDP actually means especially particular context MR PRELL mr chairman think one also note interpretation made system conference wanted way emphasis sort set aside questions damage might done terms welfare lost unanticipated inflation people saving enough retirement theres whole array welfare costs might go high unpredicted inflation theres whole area explore one wanted look reasons one concerned nonzero inflation CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN think bob right set analytical model cause effect demonstrate crucial points micro evidence relationship inflation price dispersion effects uncertainty relationship uncertainty cost capital growth build argument even data macro level insufficient largely data considerable amount noise indeed forceful tight inverse relationship exists quite possible theres enough statistical noise data system bring 100 percent R square 2 MR PRELL well recognize hard establish macro issue anything definitive research analytical points argue low inflation conceivably better inflation tried experiment also thought mission try put empirical flesh analytical bones progress made concede lack certainty122193 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN well thought memorandum really quite useful think results obtained showed fairly extensive advance state knowledge area MR BEEBE might add survey data even moderate rates inflationustype ratesdo indicate standard errors uncertainty forecasters rise level inflation even reasonable rates inflation evidence level inflation inflation uncertainty related gets back distribution issue mike alluded CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN questions go substance meeting conventional agenda sandra pianalto first time wed like welcome welcome sandy think aware last official meeting governor angell next meeting going away bash want say today may leave philosophy remain organization largely perhaps subliminally implanted ideas amongst colleagues think result cherish immensely us observed yearsand ive privilege thisyou going sorely missed lot reasons important extraordinary integrity exhibited group absolute adherence issue principle appropriate important public policy central bank going somebody else sitting seat replaced officially wish well later time want say personally professionally miss doesnt mean im going give couple extra strokes next time play tennis shall go normal procedures well start peter fisher foreign desk MR FISHER referring briefly two pages color charts carol kind enough put table front morning statementsee appendix CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN questions peter objection request desk made respect disposition currencies assume authorization move required lets go domestic desk joan lovett MS LOVETT statementsee appendix CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN thank questions joan entertain motion ratify actions intermeeting period SPEAKER move CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN since theres second without objection lets move messrs prell truman economic report122193 MR PRELL statementsee appendix MR TRUMAN statementsee appendix CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN thank questions either gentleman MR JORDAN couple questions mike look back greenbook projections 93 starting year ago balance encouraging even though intrayear pattern growth currently reported different know thats going revised away anyway lets pay much attention cumulative effect year real growth year even get 5 percent fourth quarter going projected year ago inflation probably going come slightly less measured consumer price index looks pretty good look current projection 1994 versus year ago output growth projected slightly less thought year ago next year inflation quite bit more12 34 percentage point consumer prices ive read written ive listened said still clear think inflation 1994 1995 going higher level thought year ago MR PRELL well price performance year relative expectation year ago depends series look GDP fixed weight price measure expected 310ths point higher expected 93 year ago crosscurrents price data modestthough think significant terms whether consistent expectations decelerationslowing core inflation past year somewhat lower level unemployment higher level think capacity utilization expected point see compensation data consider another important measure underlying costs trends really clear evidence ongoing deceleration even course period unemployment higher perhaps sanguine might prospects ongoing substantial deceleration move 1994 recalibrating things move along looking different initial conditions expected see enter 1994 one certainly argue variety econometric models built phillips curveone youre particularly fond ofthat significant deceleration view using model NAIRU 512 percent significant output gap normal rules thumb produce deceleration prices hand think many people say prospects arent quite rosy forecasting basic notion think likely direction trend inflation 1994 downward MR JORDAN let follow everything ive seen including teds report outside united states virtually everything anything much much weaker 93 expected year ago global marketplace model framework slack excess122193 6 capacity thought year ago time global economy say less price pressure year ago thought time MR PRELL well going significant competitive pressure imports number sectors economy though sectors sectors susceptible influence degree noted import price prospect one things makes us hopeful continue downward inflation trend import price pressure last year isnt element forecast going move significantly favorable direction 1994 anything prospects might infer less favorable contribution import price side splitting hairs think picture essentially doesnt really make big difference go forward terms rate deceleration MR JORDAN okay one point may technical question historically gap GNP deflator CPI 12 percentage point noticed widen percentage point 94 carry 95 almost full percentage point whats giving rise MR PRELL think major story ongoing increase relative importance computers whose prices decreasing rapid rate MR JORDAN translate one wrong MR PRELL well different measures think deflator optimal measure prices even broader measures consumer prices going affected computer pricing SPEAKER technical matter computers much smaller weight CPI deflator gross domestic product weight one item fall price small CPI relatively large deflator CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN president parry MR PARRY mike 1992 GDP revisions discrepancy thought saw initially hours worked output removed course GDP increased substantially first half 1993 phenomena numbers change revision well one sort pro forma revision making similar occurred 1992 implications amount slack point view toward end presentation mentioned concerns cautionary measures unintelligible MR PRELL well dont strong conviction likely magnitude direction revisions GDP personal saving rate key variables look gap potential actual real output first half year sure evidence income side somewhat rapid growth registered GDP numbers122193 isnt night day difference dont think make great deal point least leery defining precisely GDP gap looking unemployment gap difficult number construct dont think looking anticipated revisions loom large thinking inflation risks discussion might note possible revisions industrial production measures capacity utilization may stirred things indicating releasei guess month agothat february hope publishing annual revisions markets took indication anticipated major changes time dont really good fix dont real predilection toward reducing raising capacity utilization based evidence weve able process point agnostic well looking couple months MR LINDSEY ask question fiscal model last green page first greenbook section assume default law change model first third fourth quarters essentially 5 percent increase receipts im reading across top line say 15 billion increase Q1 94 ql 93 Q3 17 billion increase etc carries im puzzled timing 49 billion increase Q2 94 Q2 93 im even slightly puzzled Q2 95 Q2 94 percentage increase quarters briefly explain way timing scored government receipts MR PRELL youre talking actual unified MR LINDSEY unified budget receipts MR PRELL yes receipts MR LINDSEY come OMB okay didnt think MR PRELL case dont im sure give good answer cuff put forecast effects 93 modest differences OMB CBO estimates weve little conservative sense allowing bit greater behavioral response diminishing income tax receipts accrue april expecting see substantially higher level nonwithheld income tax payments 1993 second quarter thats key feature yeartoyear movements revenues apart generated simply ongoing increases economic activity boosting corporate personal income 1995 id look closely see lesser gain second quarter second quarter 95 94 seems reasonable cant specific point CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN well technical question dont somebody it122193 MR PRELL sure MR LINDSEY great thanks rate kind bump assume unlikely affect consumption patterns pretty much anticipated MR PRELL well isnt precisely viewing things progressed weve moved bit direction thinking larger effect first half 1994 initially allowed weve made shift direction yes true lot people knew tax increases coming began adjust behavior least timing income receipts late 1992 showed bonuses coming looking behavior consumption year one hard pressed discern anticipatory effect entirely clear everyone behaves totally rationally terms gauging lifetime income stream adjusting expenditures quickly probably number households going somewhat liquidity constrained tax time anticipating disproportionate effect first half 1994 people really calculate confront tax bills MR LINDSEY thank CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN questions like start committee discussion president broaddus MR BROADDUS moved table year ago time since ive general agreement greenbook projections ive often thought risk error bit side staff projections usually struck generally reasonable sort within confidence interval cant really say strongly time least get beyond current quarter A number things make think greenbook forecast time may significantly underestimating growth economy economic activity get 1994 first think theres good chance projected sharp deceleration consumer spending wont happen especially durable goods may get deceleration dont think going sharp greenbook projecting among things greenbook expects fiscal restraint exert fairly considerable drag consumer outlays next year maybe seems upper income people likely affected tax increases reasonably seen things coming long year ago certainly middle last year seems quite likely taxes already worked effect already whatever impact theyre going path spending going forward broadly nothing recent data suggests economy generally pull back fiscal drag fiscal restraint seems current acceleration activity quite strong basically driven interestsensitive sectors economy housing consumer spending durable goods producer spending durable equipment suggests decline real interest rates going time perhaps122193 finally showing rather fundamental way economy generally unless theres sharp backup interest rates especially longterm rates expect sectors continue bolster economic activity period ahead also im less pessimistic greenbook prospects net exports although get teds comments maybe read greenbook particular framework pessimistic actually significant reductions interest rates number industrial countries seems give us somewhat stronger recovery G6 countries greenbook appears expect standpoint compelling reason questioning staff forecast time anecdotal comments hearing district none suggests real diminution activity going forward contrary sense getting virtually directors business contacts economy gaining momentum pretty much across board give couple examples baltimore directors pretty good cross section people pessimistic last meeting last meeting positive outlook first time really since recession 9091 thing true richmond charlotte theyve somewhat optimistic several months last meeting much positive current situation outlook time getting much stronger comments business contacts lot manufacturing activity district contact people many telling us first time long time plan bring new workers within next six months havent heard significant broad degree recently also declining vacancy rates commercial property number areas district increased optimism among commercial builders real estate developers A year ago guys saying never get better add acceleration general economic activity begun raise concerns inflation among least contacts though terribly widespread yet think mentioned something mike pricing power several business contacts told us believe recently make price increases stick theyre beginning think within next six months overall cant remember time years ive heremaybe one exception early 1983when ive seen broad accumulation positive information economy nationally district think important implications policy decision today thinki hopeweve known along economy really began gain strength going let real shortterm interest rates move zero money believe frankly defer action funds rate longer think jeopardize credibility commitment price stability good things credibility economy longterm interest rates CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN president keehn122193 10 MR KEEHN mr chairman district also underlying level economic activity clearly gained momentum since last meeting virtually important sectors area shown improvement driven largely certainly exclusively auto sector auto production schedules course strong quarter first quarter next year set 13 percent first quarter year first quarter year pretty good comparative period industry estimates contribution firstquarter GDP little stronger number thats greenbook given surprising steel industry continues operate high levels shipments year come 88 million tons forecast next year ship 90 million tons 3 4 percent increase one company talked said outlook steel industry next two three years best seen fifteen years parts economy also well farm equipment business strong heavy truck business expecting even higher level sales next year year improved level experienced year turns due environmental standards become effective january 1st machine tool orders example though third quarter year october almost 30 percent retail salesand think fairly strong recent developmentreally increased quite substantially past month uneven much stronger durable goods side apparel nonetheless overall retail conditions described best prevailed three four years think id give high odds christmas season going come little better forecasts hearing employment situation also strengthened consistent al said first time remember heavy manufacturer indicated add employees one facilities far able meet increased demand increasing line speed plan add another shift require additional employees completely capacity major constraint shortage qualified drivers arent enough people available drive trucks cautiousreally rather bearish time describes employment conditions best seen quite regard national economy clearly fourth quarter come strong side think question mike outlined whether experience kind drop first quarter next year year whether quarter line staff forecast must say point think enough underlying momentum place economy decline quite likely much line staff forecast uncertainties well familiar certainly point least forecast free doubt regard pricing experiencing interesting dichotomy strong growth economic activity yet pricing conditions that122193 continue competitive despite higher demand products manufacturers dont latitude raise prices confidence increases stick continuing put tremendous pressure suppliers maintain even reduce prices many achieving considerable success whether fundamental change last whether setting stage somewhat higher prices broader basis remains seen hunch basis discussion get policy deliberations MR PRELL mr chairman clarify something earlier response president jordan GDP fixed weight price index expected CPI core CPI risen past year anticipated last december unemployment rate 14 percentage point lower got decline unemployment output growth anticipated id assert strongly broad consistency fundamental principle applied forecast continues apply thank CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN president parry MR PARRY thank mr chairman report twelfth district economy optimistic although changes california small mixed october employment district states outside california showed considerable strength employment increasing 40000 annualized economic employment growth rates month ranged 212 4 percent states idaho nevada incredibly strong actually recorded doubledigit rates expansion one thing bit surprise last month two whats happening state washington washingtons employment growth outpaced district states expanding 8 percent october following 6 percent growth september eastern washington continues reflect think correctly characterized boom conditions associated inter mountain states contacts also report business activity western washington stronger however cutbacks aerospace course remain drag regions performance californias economy remains weak although current conditions mixed recent months november payroll employment little changed recession low reached october moreover job losses continued areas construction manufacturing positive note reports contacts california longer uniformly negative retail sales improving certainly good conditions sectors motion pictures entertainment also agriculture within state economic conditions clearly weakest southern california especially los angeles area layoffs continue aerospace defense construction remains quite depressed real estate values appear continuing slide area conditions relatively stronger huge agricultural area central valley also northern california despite falling employment bay area turning national economy point think likely outlook growth roughly incorporated greenbook seems us following is122193 12 going clearly strong fourth quarter see reduction growth rates along line indicated greenbook say based upon board staffs forecast wouldnt surprising see labor market slack reduced core rate inflation incorporated greenbook however time think reasonable chance growth inflation turn stronger projected along line al talking new orders production picked areas besides autos think GDP 1993 may revised extent providing momentum growth next year result possible gap potential actual GDP may diminishing faster rate anticipated forecasts thank CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN president hoenig MR HOENIG mr chairman district continuing grow actually showing indications faster growth last half year think going 1994 construction activity still strong continue note intel building 112 billion plant new mexico adding 1000 jobs activities throughout district services seem good improving although perhaps quite strongly information getting national level manufacturing district either stabilizing actually improving smaller job losses durables real job growth nondurables sectors still declinesmcdonnell douglas american airlines maintenance operations laying workersbut thats offset job gains manufacturing farm economy stable despite flood stronger grain prices offsetting weaker cattle prices may see earnings pressure 94 energy sector actually holding despite fact oil part dead region gas activity though positive obvious relationships two gas prices still holding drilling activity going within context id like provide anecdotal data data systematic think worth noting area prices example land prices sensitive region wyoming weve sales one recent sale fairly large ranch sold perhaps 10 15 percent expected local neighboring ranchers outside investors coming north central kansas general trends still price increases around level inflation weve seen sales recently maybe 5 10 percent trend line suggest areas like denver albuquerque hearing comments boomlike conditions seeing speculation residential real estate loan growth fairly strong especially areas denver parts omaha lincoln seeing activity energy sector ive said oil prices gas prices least holding sale land lease arrangements exploration large independents told us leases selling levels significantly expected signs strong activity122193 13 price pressures systematic yet hearing often nation expect solid growth next year first quarter see bit dropoff greenbook following year whole dont see dropoff greenbook projected expect continued growth allow inflation backoff greenbook projects whether turn case certain seeing district analyzing nationwide think going fairly good growth around 3 percent throughout year inflation stay least high throughout year CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN president forrestal MR FORRESTAL mr chairman economic activity district continuing move along moderate pace think outperforming nation retail sales fall somewhat disappointing holiday activity quite good middecember certainly lot better retailers expected news relatively important tourism sector continues mixed busy season florida approaches theres still substantial concern impacts unfavorable publicity related crime activity months ago time mississippi money pouring state result gambling activity along coast indian reservations giving rise employment im certain way produce economic activity thats another issue business convention bookings quite healthy atlanta manufacturing sector pace activity steady november posting quite impressive gains october outlook area becoming steadily positive terms orders production employment think thats particularly evident outlook capital goods brightened orders picked recently producers become positive current period expansion extended negative side continued cutbacks defense aerospace well decline important apparel sector muting enthusiasm little singlefamily homes continue sell quite well around district even though inventories reduced dont reports housing price increases great extent although people trying pass along recent increases lumber prices generally speaking single family home prices moved much nonresidential commercial areas signs slow steady improvement begun take hold think areas theres pretty general feeling bottom reached outlook positive energy sector rig count louisiana fallen last two months although well level year ago concern among producers natural gas lower oil prices cause substitution effects spot gas prices marginally marginally 2 level thats needed make new drilling feasible balance continue see gains employment district service area although ive indicated there122193 14 positive signs manufacturing well see little evidence price pressures anecdotal information supports idea price increases difficult obtain even positive atmosphere anecdotal information also confirms positive things ive talked generally feeling things much better business contacts ive including directors indicate feel momentum place economy go meetings im often asked policy im also given requests frequent request get "please leave things way dont anything" respect national economy changed forecast since last meeting general agreement said last time greenbook nearterm outlook get latter part 1994 1995 think growth going somewhat stronger inflation rate higher unemployment rate somewhat lower basically difference consumer area think employment increases wages salaries going help sustain consumption growth probably order 3 percent period said forecast somewhat higher growth higher inflation continued vulnerabilities risks forecast cite particularly international outlook although indicated today situation appear little better may run risk seeing deceleration first quarter even first half 1994 although dont think going extreme last year CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN president jordan MR JORDAN generally economic activity district sector various industries wouldnt much different si keehn reported seventh district im going go different detail basically quite positive parts district describe boom conditions especially central kentucky around lexington area A lot driven motor vehiclerelated things domestic companies transplant companies quite well trucks well also theres increasing tendency banks report us business loan demand picking earlier year rather selective comes almost without exception banks say getting business loan demand residential construction strong commercial construction heavy infrastructure kinds construction district ag sector better year thought going havethe best theyve since unintelligible also see rising farmland prices reports pickup interest though weve call marginal employment growth anecdotally manufacturingtype businesses report substantial increases productivity talk increased volumes increased output without adding work force point thats contrary national policy passage NAFTA interesting course controversial lot organized labor activity district intensive activity passed almost disappeared issue feeling seems okay basically positive area and122193 15 labor organizations simply factor looks like mortgage refinancing activity slowed dramatically strength consumer side autorelated national scene cant differ forecast put greenbook assumptions policy greenbook produce kind inflation projected especially 95 find unacceptable either forecast wrong policy wrong CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN president syron MR SYRON thank well first district isnt outperforming nation seeing continued improvement id say legitimately moderate growth area boom substantial amount call boom momentum people certainly feeling lot better exception defense important connecticut parts rhode island fairly extensive sample manufacturers say balance substantially optimistic true three four years maybe even five years significant variance people generally pretty optimistic exception might expect areas produce health equipment actually seeing anticipatory turndown well defense group price side everyone anxious anything increase margins stage dont seem feel ability A lot complaining interesting situation reported us steel scrap area lot producers increase steel scrap prices resulted net reduction costs say actually increase scrap prices important lot producers sell lot steel scrap back market benefit increase finished product change mix integrated mills electric mills thats produced question look fairly carefully price data CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN youre making point clear MR SYRON okay CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN saying electric price cost structure goes shift nonelectric furnaces MR SYRON happened scrap prices know substantially CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN yes MR SYRON many users final products steel generate lot scrap increase scrap prices magnitude washed increase output price finished steel that122193 16 theyre buying say well happen turns margins electric powered furnaces gone CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN see MR SYRON happens marginal cost steel unintelligible understand integrated mills happened reduction margin electric mills CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN well nonminimill electric furnace operators big unintelligible MR SYRON understand itand si know much dothe mix changed integrated mills electric mills MR KEEHN right MR SYRON significantly CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN okay im curious MR SYRON rate far national situation goes much agree greenbook forecast general optimistic price outlook confess thats basis one might call gross macro relationships guess read phillips curves MR PRELL hope MR SYRON go think clearly difficult time terms deciding policy key question much slack economy issue strong growth going first half year even year whole simply dont know whats going happen respect issue tax increase much people adjusted consumption patterns think al correct need sensitive whole thing say depend importantly happened real economy going know CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN president boehne MR BOEHNE well upward momentum apparent middle atlantic states well weve region lagged nation think still true although clearly attitudes aggregate demand stronger seeing many parts district seeing across industries notably manufacturing true retailing residential construction although still problems nonresidential side said still tentativeness present way business people looking ahead respects trouble believing things improving tough periodbut also actions seeing kinds increases employment appear case districts think this122193 17 improved attitude substance saw year ago still going need nourishing take hold produce cumulative forward momentum need really strong economy terms pricing keep hearing difficult raise prices way protect margins still cost side theres lot pressure suppliers difficult make price increases stick implications national economy dont think know answer bottom line question similar year ago much takeoff really seeing economy think one make fairly good case either side sense see kind weakness saw year ago think improvement going forward early tell goaded tightening hawkish friends might urge us timid need willing tighten time comes think time theres still enough uncertainty call period watchful waiting id prepared need precipitous CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN president mcteer MR MCTEER growth economic activity eleventh district slowed little since last FOMC meeting actual decline employment october primarily due special circumstances including early retirement program state eliminated 6000 government jobs earlier usual hiring seasonal employees meant october registered decline seasonally adjusted construction activity strong expected remain upward trend singlefamily building major source strength throughout 1993 next year expect slow bit multifamily nonresidential activity pick slack apartment occupancy rates high since june nonresidential contract values risen annual rate almost 100 percent driven start couple 2 billion refinery projects large increase shopping center construction manufacturing employment growing 2 percent rate weekly hours gone back high 43 think highest nation manufacturing jobs continue gain strength durables electrical nonelectrical machinery instruments constructionrelated products energy markets taken gloomy tone district recently obvious reasons real terms oil prices almost low 1973 theres widespread fear recent drop oil prices sustained time hurt district people estimate job losses 50000 next two years oil prices remain 15 impact much less 1982 1986 since oil gas extraction declined 7 percent districts economy 23 percent back 1981 however whats bad southwest good country people estimate 15 oil prices lasted two years take 12 percentage point inflation rate add 34 percentage point real GDP rate nationally CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN president melzer122193 18 MR MELZER thank alan economic outlook eighth district economy continues favorable retail auto sales strong firms surveyed report increases sales orders employment loan demand continues strengthen parts commercial retail markets district banks hand sectors weakness nonresidential construction agriculture missouri experienced gains nonresidential construction contracts last half year moreover preliminary estimates suggest net farm income likely decline district states year recent firming crop prices appear large enough offset reduction farm output due bad weather flooding generally speaking however eighth district expansion appears broadbased sustainable respect national economy say outlook appears converging eighth district retail final sales strong especially relative inventory levels trends employment industrial production investment durable equipment index leading economic indicators point continuation strengthening cyclical expansion indeed improvement economy appears spilled consumer confidence indications output growth potential next year respect prices id say testimony past policy CPI increased 212 percent rate first nine months year encouraging first goal price stability achieved secondly reported improvement CPI due volatile food energy components dropped CPI increased 3 percent rate first nine months year troubling 36 percent rate past two months third CRB futures index risen sharply since september 10 percent time last year despite sharp reduction oil prices finally numbers tell us nothing inflationary thrust current policy quite stimulative measured behavior things directly influence like growth reserves M1 wait effects recent policy show inflation act waited long CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN president stern MR STERN thank mr chairman regard economy ninth district improvement thats trend way quite time stronger sectors appear consumer spending residential construction people even used language district economy "strong" thats ebullient get cautious conservative area upper midwest regard national economy think greenbook forecast reasonable internal forecast different although recall forecast significant slowing saw first half 93 gives little pause go 1994 said assuming general tenor greenbook forecast forecast turns accurate dont think matters much whether real growth122193 19 turns little rapid little slower indicated greenbook seems critical factor several people commented happens inflation neither greenbook forecast internal forecast deceleration inflation certainly cause concern hand listen anecdotal evidence least wayit appears difficult raise prices people seeing much way incoming price pressures either international situation slack available foreign economies might also tend make one little optimistic situation one thoughtand perhaps heretical neverthelessmany us accepted kind working definition price stability inflation factor economic decisionmaking perhaps little closer realize least talking business people way certainly think adjusting idea price increases simply going far CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN governor angell MR ANGELL thank mr chairman look process involve lot attention real economy twelve presidents naturally responsibility speak economic conditions district wasnt long ago various groups unifiedwell unified crossedin analysis role M2 V2 stable wanted use output gap approach inflation found stable velocity money helpful regard achieving policy conducive level output provide kind gap approach either restrain inflation produce gradual disinflation robert black frank morris certainly different perspectives crossed sense recognizing M2 information importance 1970s suppose talked disappearing money V2 onetime step confronted sense disappearing money regard role policy formation many looked money look basis predicting output gap steady growth money seen prelude directly price level stability irving fisher milton friedman anna schwartz background said right thing money end getting stable prices dont need worry real economy marketsystem economy efficient provide stable money output growth employment allocated efficiently well good end results V2 becomes totally unreliablereally became unreliable 19821983 unreliable many timesthen want follow output gap approach left without forward handle regard creating output gap thats critical monetary policy thats monetary policy know works significant variable time lag concentration upon output gap think somewhat exaggerated good work mike prell ted truman staff greenbook greenbook attempt say "well whats there" think us know best forecast really good regard knowing forecast regard growth rate forecast correct level productivity know are122193 atmosphere seems important around table continue follow closely output gap statistics clearly supportive view best predictor rate inflation output gap yet seems following approach even economically advantageous strong political disadvantage notion might take away punch bowl growth gets going position seems central bank since many follow approach prefer approach tries target price level directly also dont help M2 regard dont help M2 think ask current condition monetary policy monetary policy present neutral accommodating restraining M2 doesnt tell us think ask providing much liquidity signs see extra liquidity suppose oldest approach approach knut wicksell says natural rate interest think want follow thatwhether want concentrate real nominal ratescan look fiveyear treasury say thats market saying natural rate interest pull rate interest far away natural rate going engaged constraint ease depending direction go cant tell moving interest rates leaving whether policy consistent ive done lot workand many people helpfulin regard commodity prices money rather plentiful show commodity prices thats mixed bag panacea look commodity prices today see mixed picture see picture price oil declining federal reserves experimental index 21 commodity prices 21 percent weight oil terms passthrough effects price oil coming know favorable immediate CPI arena well CPI performs compared favorable arena may another question look best evidence commodity prices seems quite robust price gold picture ample money table ample money table leave table long enough CPI responds sense late late terms stable money sound money doesnt simply aim price level stability sound money stable money aims monetarypolicyinduced cycles seems cycles weve experienced monetary policyinduced thats somewhat forefront asking whats going take place second quarter 1994 price level effects today 1995 indeed 1996 circumstances tend al broaddus believe maintaining fed funds rate current level point time catch us catch us wont know much move take fed funds rate correct situation 3 percent weve kind head winds phenomena weve122193 21 particularly household sector duration mismatched duration mismatch much less duration mismatchwas three years ago money flowing 6month cds longerterm bond mutual funds equity mutual funds reason alone monetary policy accommodative current level rates 17 months ago checked 17 months ago september treasury bill rate reached low level market anticipated level treasury bill really current range 17 months 17 months monetary policy become increasingly accommodative know accommodation gone long US economy world economy significant real asset deflation altered behavior commercial banking industry regard making loans altered behavior people regard wanting make loans new ground really dont know soon change might take place prefer say price gold 389 ounce high last spring think many us thought price gold never go 400 leave policy alone opportunity cost holding gold conducive price gold going 400 longer let go higher goes greater tradeoff cost bringing inflation back narrow view cant see choice say lets try move closer neutral dont think us knows neutral certainly think closer 4 percent 3 percent fed funds rate bond markets tag us reluctance move think get output growth sense get lagging market im envious swisss 4 percent 10year rate tremendous increase output growth occur thought pursuing price level stability directly gave us output growth employment dont know anyone cares quality labor force ever foster favor policies lead people unemployed people bankrupt think commitment stable money stable money gives us output dont recessions thank CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN president mcdonough MR MCDONOUGH second district still relatively flat except financial services firms commercial banks investment banks well industrial service firms district especially larger ones still concentrating reducing staff improving productivity looking price increases way improve margins long discipline continue growing market talk around new york increase growth automatically translates price increases leaves doubt least price discipline larger firms district seems good control national picture part company greenbook first time quite fourth quarter 93 fourth quarter 94 forecasting GDP growth 3 percent compared greenbooks 27 percent unemployment rate believe fall 61 percent compared greenbooks 64 percent122193 22 components show robust growth consumer expenditures business fixed investment residential construction federal purchases little cases enough result larger growth picture overall surprisingly since faster growth bigger drag net exports show GDP deflator next year 3 percent compared greenbooks 212 percent 1995 even apart deflator going 33 percent differences enough believe assumption fed funds rate remaining 3 percent throughout year almost certainly going case question one certainty ones forecast say policy move evident taken yet sufficiently certain forecast think lead policy move possibility slowdown first quarter sufficiently great well advised view wait additional data come particularly waiting two statistics one first look fourthquarter GDP comes late january employment data month january scheduled come first friday february second day next meeting even though forecast todayif absolute certaintywould lead one say time take policy action imminent view prefer wait additional data reaching conclusion CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN governor kelley MR KELLEY thank mr chairman first let say think remarks early meeting concerning governor angells departure well taken may leave us physically influence certainly going remain statement minute two ago beautiful cameo hes leaving us point view want tell appreciate think us feel appropriate policy largely hands strongly one feels growth main question course pace expansion liable sustain next year looking strong fourth quarter sustainable strong rate ease back somewhat long list factors im sure everybody else mike expressed eloquently earlier wont go back somewhat harder evidence "ease back" hypothesis sustained strong growth little surprised moment ago find factors bill reverse interpretation suspect consumer ease back largely consumer saving alltime low strong consumer expenditures drive lower remain strong consumer debt right record terms relationship disposable personal income high ratio sustained order strong consumer expenditures continue seems housing likely ease cant imagine something like 143 million rate housing starts saw hold tax increase kick effect remains seen understand hit higher incomes course nevertheless defense cuts occur hope true deficit number continue get lower providing drag foreign economies may well start look better been122193 thinking recently thats going happen overnight sluggishness may well continue stretch seemed likely months sustained strength case strong al started meeting strong credible statement makes policy decision terribly close call guess ed boehne said dont know think first quarter liable start strong echo nothing else sustainable remember time last yearobviously dont exactly situation last year huge fourth quarter last yearthat took subsequent three quarters get meaningful momentum going even third quarter past impressive going get might well even though probably severely close call seems factors calling pull back apparently fourth quarter strongest case greenbook forecast something close correct possibility likelihood running inflationary problems quarters yet hard tell far depend exactly goes fast gap GDP gets closed economy somewhat stronger greenbook thats toughest call dont know say believe considerably stronger strength sustainable move immediately im quite im cautious january particularly likely echo things continued accelerate right january start get impressed think january probably going strength way one looks puts waitandsee camp CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN governor laware MR LAWARE thank mr chairman must say tendency agree concerns continued contraction military spending full impact higher taxes persisting sense job insecurity think continue driven time corporate reengineering dont see real end trend financing health care program emerges factors going continue tend dampen dump economic growth context see really compelling case policy change time spite current spurt economic growth contrary think premature move choke satisfactory growth rate timing change policy current circumstances exquisite comfortable meet next indication firstquarter outlook least point adjustment directive might appropriatesort loading gun perhaps tilting directiveif looks though staff projection modest growth first quarter going materialize secretarys note chairman greenspan left room briefly take important call vice chairman conducted meeting chairmans absence VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH governor mullins122193 24 MR MULLINS thank think developing pattern incoming data continues confirm recognize head winds continue diminish havent heard lot head winds lately traditional pattern interestsensitive spending seems well entrenched fueling sustainable moderate growth led business investment consumer spending durables especially housing dont see significant risk overly robust growth rate remaining much discussed drags economy usual suspects mike john mentioned think concerns getting little long tooth anyone doesnt know taxes gone dont much longer flog one think drags limit side somewhat however dont see significant chance economic deterioration absent shock thing momentum economy grown rate 3 percent 8 quarters growth averaged 3 percent 2 years true consumer spending sustained unsustainable levels many many quarters continues sustained unsustainable levels might get hint measuring correctly people suggest lot selfemployed people small businesses captured may right notion uncertain job climate 1992 1993 people feel confident spending lot theyre making see dont feel confident enough buy houses like despite record affordability seems inconsistent seems much likely income regardless though one talk socalled slowdown first part year pickup mean 3 percent growth average variability quarterto quarter around rateweve less average variabilitywe see quarters 1 percent 5 percent think mean 3 percent greenbook thinks 212 percent well never know sort variability fortunately dont think possible predict quartertoquarter variability retail sales growing fourth quarter 92 12 percent unsustainable even admit first quarter pulled back take two quarters together growth 33 percent second quarter inventory adjustment consumer spending continuing grow quarter inventory adjustment opposite direction pretty clear view data confirmed durability sustainability economic growth process im getting bit tired holding breath two years since believe much clarified last several months sense weve another one normal sorts variations think time take stock see 17 months almost six quarters since lowered federal funds rate 3 percent actually lowered 75 basis points summer 92 think worth reviewing basic rationale moving 3 percent federal funds rate lowest funds rate almost 30 years junior fayetteville high school last time federal funds rate weve real shortterm interest rates approximately zero marginally negative much time recall basic rationale take insurance sideto weigh risks summer 92 deterioration the122193 25 fledgling recovery worked downside insurance paid

mentioned peak last cycle late 80s 848 83 unemployment summer 92 77 percent 64 percent nowbetter say quickly CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN 65 percent MR MULLINS yes 65 percent using concurrent seasonals well percentage point last year half might ask might year half know come last year half point might think know theres going measurement change kick dont think misled factory workweek factory overtime stand postworld war II highs nearterm growth outlook portends continued growth employment see possibility lower unemployment guess lot changed year half weve gone uncertain recovery expansion mature least adolescent signs suggest secure footing think market risks perceptions changed well last summer stock market record levels weak firsthalf GDP performance concern market getting ahead economic fundamentals six months later market gone essentially sideways half year economic outlook caught market current backdrop 5 percent fourth quarter improved confidence economic growth next year longer hear scare stories market fragility probably means worry sense economic outlook filled underneath market short world changed federal funds rate changed downside economic risk diminished substantially extinguished entirely death downside risks view taken basic rationale accommodative monetary stance place year half longer need potentially costly insurance downside risk needed summer 92 compare environment conditions motivated us go 3 percenti simply think performance economy currently prospectively longer justifies accommodative stance world changed time come next several months begin process moving toward neutral sustainable stance one appropriate growing economy much diminished downside risks see convincing signs accelerating inflationary pressures time favor taking insurance side moving restrictive policy high real rates course know long lags associated inflation policy actions sit accommodative policy inflationary pressures clearly visibly embedded know late game late restrictive policy required look late 80s 10 percent funds rate recession needed turn one around122193 26 think aware false sense security getting inertia sitting accommodative policy long rationale policy disappeared made obsolete progress economy rather let inertia produce wider swings policy economic activity political pressures result considerable risk objective sustained progress toward price stability think better path start move policy toward even keel still time think help secure low inflation environment low longterm rates sustained economic growth simply put job view pretend suggest policy journey entirely pleasant unfortunately job course beginning move accommodative neutral surprise one think consensus forecast private economists short rates move moderately next year expected markets implicit forwards futures prices regardless rhetoric administrations official forecast favor immediate change thin markets yearend pressures helpful december 91 rates coming might helpful opposite direction favor change linked statistics economic growth unemployment see compelling case going asymmetry since move view dependent potentially triggered receipt data intermeeting period criterion use directive biasif im waiting piece data move next year think committee debate issue make careful assessment progress prospects economy reach consensus hope shall perhaps take first step meeting carefully considered marginal realignment stance policy rather response specific incoming data sum look economy see much changed economic environment one faced summer 92 thing hasnt changed federal funds rate view concerns led us establish 3 percent federal funds rate longer present rationale accommodative stance longer valid time fast approaching begin realignment policy accommodative stance appropriate struggling uncertain recovery year half ago neutral stance appropriate sustainable expansion today thank CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN governor lindsey MR LINDSEY thank mr chairman want second governor kelley said wayne angells departure mr chairman used word "subliminal" effect may say phrase "subliminal never subtle" laughter CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN accept MR LINDSEY two puzzles everyone discussing one unsustainably low personal saving rate absence price pressures presence rather122193 27 high capacity utilization rate two thoughts ive thought since havent come thought id throw two cents worth first relates consumer general pretty happy gotten three tax cuts first OPEC thats 120 family 4 barrel second refinancing home 100000 mortgage 700 800 year easily thirdly taxpayers 28 percent bracket includes people taxable incomes say 35000 85000 january 1 get tax cut 200 300 indexing works well encourage people things going way theres still tax increase coming think seeing effects think coming entirely savings one need calculations im sure higher income people facing see money coming alternative paying uncle sam say regular shortterm vehicle real aftertax return shortterm vehicle minus 112 percent doesnt make sense hold kind cash may well dissave think decline saving rate weve witnessed really among scared middle upward middle classes worried jobs rich dissaving key disagreement greenbook come 49 billion extra revenue expecting see second quarter going materialize think half see low saving rate people putting money asset redeployment first reemergence 1 million home actually 1250000 home 80 percent financing 1 million maximum mortgage qualifies deduction know rich people majority always paid cash homesgee nice situation betell fact taking mortgages first time 1 million range nice saving furthermore nice form longterm cheap funds nominal aftertax cost mortgage someone say new york right 312 percent thats nominal tax cost sounds like borrowing money free 30 years thats pretty good deal expect see result bunch asset rediversification flow funds real estate also durables untaxed wonder boom areas economy hearing indicative wyoming example heard boom real estate particularly true around jackson hole low moderate income housing longer available californiatype prices coming thats another way sheltering money another asset rediversification dividend paying stocks OTC stocks 85 percent OTC stocks im told outperformed DOW year nondividend paying basically speculative utilities hit spite favorable interest rate environment theyre high dividend paying classic new issues boston chicken virginian im outraged id suggest opening virginia corned beef cabbage fight back laughter maybe make money think al types diversification make sense hold commodities seeing prices go firm purchase business equipment weve record boom important mr chairman mentioned122193 28 earlier going inflation without CI loans going crazy go CI loans dont want bring cash books youve got plenty already dispose cant pay borrow house portfolio use money something thats going give deduction front way want keep cash company pay youre going push way rather pulling way think thats seeing think low personal saving rate rich faced confiscatory tax rates second issue price pressures spite boom conditions think traded goods traded nontraded goods going see 1 million houses land wyoming go price missed forecast early 80s last time hit negative real interest rates ignored outside world thought budget deficits us fact borrowed abroad check time rest world us going restrain price pressures well monetary policy first think current monetary policy exacerbating effects tax cuts keeping real aftertax rates decidedly negative furthermore want keep restraint price pressure abroad think ultimately way going perhaps see appreciation dollar surprises going abroad going government germany end year bundesbank seems caught gloomy picture japan japanese near liquidity trap situation perhaps one way helping dilemma look relative decline currency relative increase dollar think foreign situation anything calls action part finally agree 3 percent funds rate unsustainable also know always act late particularly impressed presentation yesterday showed long monetary policy lags better act worried inflation 95 think modest adjustment along lines governor mullins talking aboutaway highly accommodative toward neutralwould help stabilize destabilized parts economy CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN finally governor phillips MS PHILLIPS clearly economy strong fourth quarter firm footing going 94 think interesting thing people right also believing things better confidence perhaps employment situation stronger people voting feet spending borrowing administration saying 3 percent growth good thats projection 94 seems reinforcing fact economy well helping people feel better wont go list reasons economy appears stronger footing suffice say adds assurance 212 yearalmost 2 years 11 monthsrecovery sustainable financial sector certainly well positioned support122193 29 growth find camp believe slowdown early next year back 212 3 percent track think still head winds drags economy work defense government cutbacks tax increase health care reform hearing comments around table seem different different parts country discussion health care reform suggested going net cost federal government fact going reduce deficit think much attention cost employers serve another tax corporate downsizing restructuring layoffs likely continue employment quality effects may continue exert pressures slowdowns europe japan continued considerations respect inflation recent numbers consistent continued deceleration inflation certainly improvements modest worrisome signs horizon however respect inflation general acceptance 3 percent right number example administration price gold elevated quite fact likely start hitting capacity problems activity picks indeed construction industrial materials pricesscrap steel lumberare food prices projections food price increases going 94 began problem related floods another year bad crops effect going work way food chain well see oils meats think recent backup weve seen longterm rates showing deterioration inflation expectations id hate count energy import prices hold inflation CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN thank much im certain coffee available need go break lets make reasonably short coffee break MR KOHN statementsee appendix CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN questions MR SYRON early year asymmetric stretch long asymmetric MR KOHN two meetings may july MR SYRON pattern years asymmetry one direction another whats longest episode weve asymmetric one direction done anything MR KOHN dont know table put together doesnt episodes number asymmetries moves made asymmetries course two year move 92 six asymmetries moved three times 91 five five 90 four five 89 two five 88 four six 87 two five calculations 60 percent time asymmetrical subsequently122193 30 moved direction asymmetry 65 66 percent took last two MR ANGELL meetings 87 asymmetrical first go asymmetrical march meeting MR KOHN august 18th asymmetrical toward firming oh youre right early year must asymmetrical toward tighteningi dont complete record herebut went back symmetry back toward firming august back symmetry toward ease crash MR ANGELL right MR SYRON ask mirror question rough recollection portion times weve taken action without asymmetric words 60 percent time asymmetric something percentage time something asymmetric MR KOHN well table right goes 87 november year took seven actions symmetric directives MR SYRON compared many altogether MR KOHN 20 asymmetric directives MR MULLINS july 92 unintelligible MR LINDSEY imagine kind relationship lagshow long takes us start raising ratesand far raise good ideas rules thumb MR KOHN dont rules thumb governor lindsey point trying make delay inflation expectations particular get going youre going raise rates cover higher inflation expectations MR LINDSEY even MR KOHN certain inflation target youre going overshoot get dont rule thumb depend cycle far MR LINDSEY case think 66 fed implemented one small increase remember much increase long lasted MR KOHN dont CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN questions several people mentioned speed meeting im122193 going compress views since generally agree number arguments made first let say rather obvious point acceleration seeing heavily motor vehicles though fully means also see steel markets number commodity markets remarkable big factor motor vehicles industry still economy sales levels moved significantly scrappage levels one calculate engineering point view normal structure scrappage mean sales levels go higher cant grow time pace theyve growing since talking rate growth GDP even automobile sales flattened higher levels definition gross auto product inventory change goes zero change think seeing combination motor vehicles residential construction latter tending also lead factor auto sales dont know whether subscribe mike kelleys view hard believe go higher go higher running resistance looking autos construction say expansion going flatten fast trouble process occurs engenders incomes even though leaders slow sudden find look business cycle history begin fade secondary industries begin come probably non computerrelated capital goods types activities cash flow engendered corporate sector business sector generally think fairly impressive looking likelihood rate gain industrial production probably getting inventory effect cant large presumption get monthly industrial production increases 7 9 going consumption square history nonetheless still yet see indications lead times material deliveries moving sure operating rates moved extraordinary rise import penetration across board country made domestic operating rates less indicative nature pressures system theres extent become extraordinarily well internationalized one argue saving rates low therefore consumption expenditures slow abruptly trouble saving rates know notoriously poor estimates often find fact werent thought event evident willingness part consumers start taking debt indication stage unduly pressed unwilling spend theyre running income think 5 percent GDP growth rate whatever get fourth quarter technically unsustainable fact greenbook indicates disaggregate gross auto product accounts 2 percentage points 4 coming unintelligible statistical adjustment issue whether governor mullins said expansion sustainable looks increasingly sustainable doesnt look yet though getting surge credit demands system usually tinder inflationary acceleration think pointed122193 credit numbers finally beginning move dont see loan data beginning see net debt nonfinancial sector starting rise still moving slow pace relative history finally beginning move leads conclude number concluded days accommodation got think correctly moved rate balance sheet structural restraints exposed turned exceptionally successful policy balance sheet adjustments indeed occurrednot yet fully still clearly way go rate change slowed dramatically marginal increases balance sheet adjustments come longer absorbingas used put itthe excessive head winds impact saw earlier time therefore recovery seems finally moving manner requiring significant tightening central bank surely indicate degree accommodation must soon eased dont know occur find difficult believe go long 1994 without starting process thats unlike way usually think thingsthat one thing timeits pretty obvious recovery taking broad general characteristics historically say got legs process single upward adjustment whole succession way restoring unintelligible positioning policy stance closer neutrality agree wayne angell said means funds rate closer 4 percent 3 percent think policy largely necessary avoid making bad mistake question judgment begin dont see material reason begin today conceive conditionsin event lot things begin acceleratewhere might desirable move next meeting happens think worthwhile consultation committee rather putting something directive time authorizes desk move intermeeting interval crucial move begin major policy adjustment judgment think point start something requires full committee consulted prior action taken therefore conclude stage vote formally unchanged policy symmetric directive clear understanding unless outlook suddenly deteriorates far rapid pace seems even remotely likely consider moving path fairly early year merely put general discussion president jordan MR JORDAN remark suggested something communicating actions hadnt considered next action communicated easing degree accommodation easing move think im increasingly troubled rhetoric outsideby people looking doand sometimes even within committee notion growth per se reduces purchasing power money puts us way perceived maybe perceive says antiinflation antigrowth lot trouble with122193 33 slack model phillips curve kind tradeoff calls forecast things like capacity sorts things trouble even people operate framework suggest careful saying want maintain degree unemployment idle capacity subpotential growth something CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN well let say fully agree say issue credit MR JORDAN like see us setting objective four five years fact hope bluebook february meeting gives us longerterm indication price level path belief objective moving price stability measured somehow say four five years conduct actions way achieve objective level output standards living people go operate way maintain past rate inflation dont know whether staff projections show thats conviction talk times speeches articles though reason moving price level stability stabilizing purchasing power money order enhance standards living growth conduct affairs shortterm way though trying restrain growth worried economy growing rapidly partly conceptual theoretical issue partly communications issue far shortterm actions agree suggestion symmetric like see asymmetric directive critical nature move also agree comments governor mullins made waiting certain data trigger action take issue suggestion bill mcdonough made january release fourthquarter GDP february release nonfarm payroll employment data january numbers going come strong last thing want perceived reacting strong numbers knock think numbers going strong better move ahead numbers CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN president boehne MR BOEHNE think days degree accommodation numbered likely sooner rather later well reduce level accommodation think however period waitandsee move believe committee vote explicitly make decision important reason think symmetrical directive face issue squarely time comes everybody record saying "this going do" CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN president parry MR PARRY mr chairman think quite likely current quarter see moderate growth next year therefore support alternative B little hard for122193 34 reach conclusion risks symmetrical leads direction thinking case asymmetry toward restraint easily buy symmetry also get ed boehne offered CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN president broaddus MR BROADDUS mr chairman certainly respect position said earlier think accumulation positive economic news seeing really quite extraordinary situation think time come let real shortterm interest rates rise order make expansion sustainable one keep getting hand side really think need move recognize certainly arguments moving yet fact always arguments know long experience get lot trouble wait long wait time risk significant deterioration inflation expectations risk backup longterm interest rates view risks kind outcome harm economy cost terms growth jobs production general health economy significantly greater moderate tightening monetary policy say moderate tightening mind something like 14 point interest rates know turn direction know thats important 14 point increase exactly lethal weapon regard think 12 point backup longterm interest rates weve seen recently warning still time heed realize course difficult time fed attack number fronts view makes imperative signal clearly promptly going distracted principal longerterm objective favor 14 point increase funds rate CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN president forrestal MR FORRESTAL mr chairman thought forecast correct fulfilled certainly want move sooner rather later think probability forecast turn right one enough uncertainties surrounding forecast want wait little longer make sure recovery expansion fact sustainable prefer wait agree prescription score also think important others indicated crucial timeat turning point crossroadsthat take action meeting also prefer symmetric directive CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN governor lindsey MR LINDSEY comments ive heard far suggest incompatibility agree want take action meeting think thats important also think jerry jordan said true dont want reacting high real growth number thats simply bad policy also bad PR nothing growth february meeting coincides release real GNP number know going highi believe thats correctyes122193 35 MR MULLINS dont know MR LINDSEY well betting number going high think released friday isnt correct MR PRELL employment report MR LINDSEY first release GNP number fourth quarter MR PRELL 20th january MR LINDSEY last statistic meeting strong real growth number think wed perceived reacting high real growth number wed probably strong employment report following therefore dont see us acting february meeting see us postponing march moved brings back logic best time move right 14 point increase show simply responding strong real growth CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN president syron MR SYRON mr chairman support proposal always going acting situation uncertainty thats way certain wouldnt need think time come going make mistake err side tightening rather staying nonneutral position think direction prepared go ordinarily might think asymmetry situation enhance credibility maintain credibility much better group act whole time move made hope done degree consistent spirit across group time done strongly favor staying symmetric CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN president mcteer MR MCTEER came meeting mr chairman thinking time coming soon ease accelerator bit probably wasnt yet influenced much statements messrs broaddus angell lindsey mullins think mr mullins gave good argument something although dont think conclusion close call whether wait go ahead something however im glad three reasons try split difference change adopt asymmetric directive one tend frequent use asymmetric directives principle primarily main thing inhibiting moving prompter release decisions think need move use asymmetric directive complicates general number two dont want us appear responding strong growth statistics think statistics going strong next weeks move going appear antigrowth think public understand inflation thing growth third reason one someone mentioned and122193 36 likely beginning series moves important enough us meeting participate decision rather tighten slightly change asymmetric directive im prepared follow suggestion CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN president melzer MR MELZER favor increasing degree pressure reserve positions think economys momentum intensified point capacity maintain moderate inflation mention declining inflation appears run mentioned growth narrow money reserve aggregates quite stimulative nearly seven quarters current cyclical expansion last year alone monetary base allowed increase 35 billion order maintain federal funds rate target level joan mentioned mirror image additions portfolio magnitude minimum think funds rate allowed move line market interest rates least prevent monetary policy automatically shifting toward inflationary stance nominal interest rates rise expanding economy addition credibility gained increasing degree pressure reserve markets may help us restrain inflationary expectations almost certain intensify improving level economic activity CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN president hoenig MR HOENIG mr chairman said earlier think information evidence mounting economy sustain next year inflationary pressures inclined see rates moved modestly sense anticipating im certainly willing see goes first year reason also feel strongly agreedupon action committee agree proposal CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN vice chairman MR MCDONOUGH mr chairman agree "B" symmetric let say think combination great many outside remarks accompanied remarks number usfirst person pluralhave made led world believe anti growth thats bad position bad monetary policy bad economics bad within public sector live think need educational exercise part central bank explain goals involve combined objective sustained growth price stability probably said humphreyhawkins testimony difficult humphreyhawkins testimony clear enough average intelligent layman understand perhaps speech taken advantage time lay sustained growth price stability mean terms average voting citizen understand really think need that122193 37 regards data come early 1994 mention existence datathe first measurement fourthquarter GDP january employment datawas point forecasts wrong high side firstquarter flop affect timing im absolutely convinced bring monetary policy neutral stance early part next year timing related education effort find necessary release specific data fact opposed way seem lead observer conclusion data led action far whether directive symmetric asymmetric believemaybe strongly anything ive statedthat symmetric since highly highly likely dont firm policy today next meeting asymmetric directive anythingon top two asymmetric directives correctly didnt change policy summer 1993could easily put us posture substituting asymmetric directives action even though think policy firmed sooner rather later valiant central banker appear somebody waves little flag soon shots come across pulls back think unattractive public relations impact asymmetric directive quite counterproductive real purpose CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN president keehn MR KEEHN mr chairman also favor alternative B symmetric language seem environment one policy stance heading asymmetry toward tightening think question timing key firstquarter data begin come rather fourthquarter data dont think going much available tell us first quarter really coming id prefer stay CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN governor laware MR LAWARE im little puzzled fact almost everyone spoken far said convinced going tighten sooner rather later yet willing buy stand pat symmetric language directive right even though everybody expressing concern reacting strong numbers seems mixed problem im mind find hard disagree much greenbook projection therefore im reluctant take action prematurely stated earlier comments arrived prescription policy slightly different points view support "B" symmetric CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN governor angell MR ANGELL mr chairman certainly feel im good company MR LAWARE long laughter122193 38 MR ANGELL john im correct think minutes conference call might published february 9th correct MR BERNARD committee makes decision yes MR ANGELL words committee made decision knows MR LAWARE good MR ANGELL theres much said agree wont emphasize think correct isnt right go asymmetric directive need act meeting think agree many made fine statements saying "dont react strong employment growth numbers" chairmans statement really helpful regard im going add one tough deal right dont make 25 basis point move reason far away neutral believe much better wait week two get 50 25 25 misaligned time bond market reacts strongly believe actor actthat 50 basis points remember 1970s jiggling along moves 18th percentage point didnt work hard start moving rates 87 believe initially raised funds rate 25 basis points move meeting move asymmetric directive march MR KOHN im sure governor angell MR ANGELL think put rate 25 basis points bond market went another 50 basis points course wasnt enough wasnt alan greenspan came really said "hey wait minute" caught bad timing situation think 50 basis points really think 50 basis points reason nowor whenever next opportunity isis unexpected bad things happen go along get employment number get get doesnt seem right time caught may 1987 remember paul volcker called manley johnson said effect "look guys wanting increase rates im telling want let know" every day looked markets including foreign exchange value dollar strong found excuse every day didnt anything made difficult 50 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN president stern MR STERN find something close call dont think evidence persuasive move support prescription said think long try come grips mean effective price stability also think obligation come grips evidence work messrs stockton beebe presented terms empirical benefits of122193 reducing inflation modest levels dont think gloss question theory CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN governor kelley MR KELLEY mr chairman choice gets tougher tougher first subscribe prescription factors sides exceptionally well articulated morning every one high level validity make choice certainly support prescription timing seems issue minds pace economy guess largely going determine agnostic timing issue point easily see governor laware suggests may need sooner later well see appreciate desire together CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN governor phillips MS PHILLIPS well seem tightening inevitable appropriate issue formwith asymmetric directive first direct move certainly agree need meeting question timing early chance derailing recovery think risk slight late sort perennial fed problemwere going chasing market rates even problem wed lose confidence bond markets crucial growth preference go ahead tighten im sure terrific damage waiting time definitely coming CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN governor mullins MR MULLINS theres certainly strong logic moving sense dont think need wait confirmation two years 3 percent growth enough wait third year might miss entire expansion laughter terms 14 percentage point versus 12 point like governor angells concept may possible difficult make move moving think also advantage holding steady whileand knows maybe bit whereas quarter treadmill inevitably get dragged market think advantage let market lead us wont exactly getting ahead market get started something said 50 basis point move regardless whether 25 50 think theres plenty economic case market case though concerns even quarter thats small amount couldnt find effect economyit big signal turning point theres capitalized value impact markets markets thin around holiday time december 91 helped us lot cut rates sorts markets set rally one aroundwith two people bidding prices three weeksbut probably hurt us support "B" symmetric122193 40 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN weve got everybody lets try "B" symmetric MR BERNARD "in implementation policy immediate future committee seeks maintain existing degree pressure reserve positions context committees longrun objectives price stability sustainable economic growth giving careful consideration economic financial monetary developments slightly greater reserve restraint slightly lesser reserve restraint might acceptable intermeeting period contemplated reserve conditions expected consistent moderate growth M2 M3 coming months" CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN call roll MR BERNARD chairman greenspan yes vice chairman mcdonough yes governor angell A soft president boehne yes president keehn yes governor kelley yes governor laware yes governor lindsey pass president mcteer yes governor mullins yes governor phillips yes president stern yes governor lindsey CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN one additional item agenda want raise want comment notion al broaddus raised pressures institution many variable continued long beseech separate monetary policy discussions words trade way policy prescriptions decide table grounds event occurring might change view monetary policy primary responsibility everything else secondary isolate activity central bank issues going battlefields one issue decide today question request chairman gonzalez respect october 15th tapes essentially come view like come herenot aideand listen tapes look transcript thats stepping earlier position wanted us ship tapes transcripts hill best judge say vagueness hes accusing us conspiring somehow october 15th meeting hide transcripts somehow decide tell like remember particular meeting one discussed considerable length pros cons releasing transcripts indeed concluded end meeting wanted effectively replicate particular discussion hill evidence see extremely difficult determine accusation is122193 coming indeed letter sent chairman recently spelled views evidence type environment exist ive indicated previously one deepseated suspicion institution regrettable guess comes turf think important put notions particular conspiracy behind us thing saying believe chairman gonzalez cease pressure us think important however position respect remainder congress public large perceived invariably accuse us trying hide tapes theres something accordingly id like put whole issue rest im talking october 15th issue dont think put issues rest quickly recommend committee allow chairman gonzalezs staff attorney listen tape meeting several people choosing preliminary view invite senior aide congressman leach ranking minority member banking committee chief aide subcommittee chairman kanjorski whose committee essentially oversees organization obvious reason prevent inevitable danger arises people picking choosing individual lines sentences probably two three mild ones transcript frankly ive read transcript accusations wholly without merit evidence transcript support accusations sentences taken context readily employed raise issue thats one reasons want sure people basically say "this nonsense" must say make recommendation reluctance potential precedential nature october 15 meeting however deliberative meeting monetary policy request made transcripts tapes monetary policy deliberative processes go think wed choice say "no" unequivocally may choose find means obtain thats congresss initiative far concerned think stand pat given issue considerable thought gone various alternatives ive around town government related jobs since 1968 know politics town pretty well tell strongly considered judgment important get behind us therefore put table recommendation like respond questions vice chairman VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH dont questions comment youre prepared CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN questions well comments questions VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH know recommendation making us one youve reached pain great deal thought think fact particular meeting tape transcript go are122193 42 different meetings tapes transcripts subject preparing testimony hill great many people present obviously conspiracy intention anyones part conspire anything certainly deprive congress information however accused accusation continuing taken considerable life promulgated among members congress among population general country others way placing question integrity committee federal reserve think respond responded letter dont think defense complete without taking painful step recommend cant imagine us say agree great joy agree recommend others well CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN governor kelley MR KELLEY mr chairman first part statement understand say chairman gonzalez indicated approach youre taking acceptable CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN thats requested MR KELLEY hes requesting people come listen tape CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN yes people MR KELLEY people CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN thats correct MR KELLEY difference suggestion said acceptable wed congressional staff present well CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN correct MR KELLEY well case mr chairman fully happily endorse approach think definitely forthcoming played idea suggesting go ahead fully release agreeable chairman gonzalez make suggestion CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN written letter MR KELLEY didnt know MR KOHN asked make tape transcript "available review" words MR KELLEY available review MR ANGELL means send there122193 43 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN fact indicated via telephone wanted one people come board listen tape hes made request MR KELLEY CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN governor lindsey MR LINDSEY mr chairman two questions first id like follow MR WINN mr chairman letter front fact two different letters one dated december 17 said "please provide committee staff access transcript tape october 15th conference call" one december 3 says "please make transcript tape FOMC conference call available committee staff review next week" somewhat ambiguous put think understand CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN recollection called call come listen tape point MR WINN called obviously come view table recordings etc guess understood call mean coming CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN well let put way recommendation SPEAKER unintelligible take notes MR MULLINS yes MR LINDSEY happensand understand youd want people herethere possibility people come go away different interpretations MR SYRON A likelihood MR LINDSEY chairman gonzalezs representatives might conspiratorial interpretation people might listen case wed "yes didnt" discussion think wed think reaction likely outcome unfortunately dont believe end people involved listening involve ultimately governor kelley intimated might unfortunate longrun result actual release see different outcome CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN possible remember results ambiguous doesnt necessarily mean get fully clarified im sure well ever satisfy certain people122193 44 MR LINDSEY well trying dispel suspicion conspiratorial types always believe conspiracy long someone whispering word conspiracy CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN let suggest conceivable may resolve totally point address condition face dont think make decision point may necessary MR LINDSEY depends likelihood second question id ask counsel FOMC ever authorized either taping meetings permanent retention transcripts MR MATTINGLY im aware MR LINDSEY theres MR MATTINGLY 1976 MR LINDSEY thats correct right taping meeting without authorization committee MR KOHN technically yes thats correct MR MULLINS policy CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN governor phillips MR PHILLIPS question think allowing folks come listen going resolve CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN think resolve october 15th issue resolve issue assaults institution various different areas MS PHILLIPS well taking step guess think next steps might next things coming pike raised question precedent CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN please remember monetary policy deliberations MS PHILLIPS yes actually call dont really know said session im trying think next steps statements taken context different people im wondering likely stir pot fact make worse standing pat CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN think MS PHILLIPS difficult judgment call CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN think vice chairman said particularly delightful activity president syron MR SYRON mr chairman find guide actions issues way nearly bad seem people even thinkingim suggesting122193 45 thisthat people listened conversation monetary policy today impressed degree "technicalness" thats brought judgments amount information think suffer generallyits raised dimensions herefrom misunderstanding public conspiracy theories abroad land business feed avoid favor suggestion precedential ways regard concerned though favor going ahead immediate step personally dont feel issues ability talk going testimony necessarily bound request banking committee staff feel properly advised extent binding dont think reasonable go future inevitably believe cant discussions among nature going proceed cant advised among counsel committee degree able best CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN may say something thats proper part discussion next month MR SYRON separate issue CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN next month going discussing whole procedure going move forward respect means taking minutes communication like MR SYRON support reason mentioned want mind comfortable think area way constrain us things think probably CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN answer "not knowledge" yet unintelligible president broaddus MR BROADDUS support suggestion strongly mr chairman think theres risk possibility proposed wont resolve fully ultimately release entire tape one meeting thats tough hardhitting conversation think youre absolutely right weve got get thing behind us conspiracy accusations even happens say go ahead CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN governor angell MR ANGELL mr chairman support proposal wonder whether theres prestep might taken set context little better id like virgil respond im wondering whether previous review banking committee staff state categorically think tape show CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN letter MR ANGELL letter122193 46 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN fact thats one issues MR ANGELL yes state theres ambivalence think approach ambivalence theres news value actual looking CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN fact discussing earlier thats exactly suggested letter response chairman gonzalez say see tapes show following MR ANGELL right vulnerability emerged many us thought began preparing testimony notes take even us knowledge seemed committees procedures secretariat said said clear unequivocal responsibility chairman reveal information question raised individual members put testimony course independent knowledge testimony discussion recall members saying well need put testimony think need set point clearly individuals asking question never doubt secretary going reveal fully existence tapes one recall view wanting tapes knew CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN president keehn MR KEEHN mr chairman agree proposal certainly support question raise really relates access people monetary policy discussion gather therefore something discovered freedom information act CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN well interesting question think thats type thing discuss february meeting relative proceed generally MR KEEHN well im really raising issue october 15th tape transcript one somebody comes asks freedom information act going deliver right CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN dont ask general counsel MR MATTINGLY wouldnt thats deliberative material MR KEEHN MR MATTINGLY disclose dont think waive right make available oversight committee MR KOHN FOIA isnt aimed monetary policy exemption aimed deliberative process whatever outcome is122193 47 MR MATTINGLY A lot october 15th tape attorneyclient material anyway MR KEEHN well agree wondered fact end disclose whether tactically might advantage releasing publicly time give committee thats risk CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN governor laware MR LAWARE along lines october 15 conference call meeting committee protectable deliberative open oversight committee precedent open deliberative matters monetary policy oversight committee MR MATTINGLY dont think MR LAWARE boy thats delicate differentiation MR MATTINGLY ive expressed MR MULLINS part meeting open example isnt monetary policy MR MATTINGLY well think MR LAWARE well deliberating something MR MULLINS oh okay MR MATTINGLY grant access secretariats records october 15 meeting doesnt mean grant access meetings FOMC either monetary policy part something else MR LAWARE thats part worries CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN well thats side MR LAWARE think good gamble try ploy hope presence witnesses see whole thing objectively able defuse attempt take pieces context advantageous think thats good strategy pursue support recommendation mr chairman CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN thank president hoenig MR HOENIG two questions mr chairman number one proposal members committee senior aides coming condition individuals chairman gonzalezs group coming words others included CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN well obviously stop us making materials available people MR HOENIG right122193 48 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN decides participate conditions may choose go forward without participation MR HOENIG want make sure something doesnt occur come look CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN say mistake MR HOENIG agree id feel much comfortable proposal knowing individuals second question memory short possibility take look parts transcript conversations get call well know exactly CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN yes check MR HOENIG case support CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN president forrestal MR FORRESTAL mr chairman suppose theres question people willing come assume CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN dont think theres problem MR FORRESTAL well said well earlier disagreeable distasteful go thisand perhaps overstating itbut think almost necessity take kind step look going resolve issue mr gonzalez staff going keep us matter accused secretive thats around country nowweve seen editorials oni think weve got dispel extent importantly wei wasnt call othershave accused lying engaged conspiracy challenged seems real way use best evidence call letters write anybody else writes going convince anybody unless get material prove irrefutably understand occur think youve made meaningful distinction kind meeting telephone call monetary policy decision think draw line say think youve said continue withhold monetary policy deliberations congress chooses tell us otherwise mean whole congress thats business want change law wouldnt move beyond furnish monetary policy transcripts unless forced whole congress CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN president parry MR PARRY mr chairman support recommendation two questions deny access likely mind chairman gonzalez try get committee to122193 49 issue subpoena secondly likely hed successful since isnt monetary policy issue probably viewed lot people house something sort got together develop tactics testifying CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN remember accusation engaged form conspiratorial action members banking
