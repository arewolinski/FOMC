united states 36 MR JORDAN okay I accept thatand ther e nothing simulation suggests change imminent let come question slightly different way i’m trying understand bette r let’s start panel lower left exercise involves assumption dollar devalued 25 percent first reaction say “okay that's useful exercise go through” I started thinking fact dollar declining 25 percent value time period currencies

laughter MS JOHNSON think problem japanese economy confronting i’m personally quite pessimistic japan I don't think anything positive going happen time soon people buying japanese equities clearly feel differently felt people putting upward pressure yen feel differently japanese economy might appear restructuring nd recovering might appear offer returns road quite attractive N onetheless japanese current account surplus means exchange rate s interest rates japanese investors persuaded acquire net claims rest world every monthno matter whatgoing forward daunting thought one might well believe going hard wh ile japanese economy begins recover MR JORDAN maybe japanese ricardians let ask dave stockton question chart 15 I may intere sting scenarios gets back I think 37 governor meyer’s comment simulation differe nces forecast models staff’s model scenario 1 sta ff’s model wouldn’t case least partial analysis given acceleration productiv ity corresponding increase real GDP growth

along obviously shortrun scenario I think simulations presented bluebook tried give flavor cas e mi dst acceleration productivity equilibrium real funds rate ha s go along effect says could hold another two years d experience period unemployment rate declines even inflation rate basically stays end two years need ultimately sense funds rate entire structure interest rates move higher longer

don’t get automatic increase real rate would come along decele ration inflation therefore real rate rise future get things back balance MR STOCKTON constant federal f unds rate scenario small increase real federal funds rate becau se slightly lower inflation rate point exactly correct MR JORDAN okay thank CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN president parry MR PARRY karen I question japan recently finance ministry

capital injection banking system would suggest perhaps banks real ly turned corner japan I must admit seems reallyto use neutra l term“interesting” time longterm postal savings deposits coming due ing renewed 25 percent finance ministry going borrow banks whic h narrow private group 21 percent seems would cause tremendous political problems MS JOHNSON information I new york times article I read ta

couple things worry one seems odds bank japan another concern t hose jgbs sitting going sell enormous capital losses japanese longte rm rates really move end banking system put large amount capital

difference PCE price number MR PRELL short run exchange ra te dynamics exaggerate response that’s probably important elemen t getting effect big MR STERN right let ask bluebook sacr ifice ratio I don’t know credibility assump tion seems really high MR KOHN little higher we've past much consistent model looking longer run fairly high sacrifice ratio I think compared models bounds baseline simulation next two years 1 percent plus NAI RU gap small upward creep inflation implies pretty high sacrifice ra tio that’s great unemployment rate NAIRU doesn’t result much upward creep inflation obviously want lower inflation lot ab ove NAIRU long time get inflation 42 come sacrifice ratio intended consistent basic story greenbook terms fast inflation would accelerate next years given assumed

GREENSPAN questions bill MR JORDAN I troubled ideai know said last year repeated herethat faster productivity growth mean s raise money growth ranges I 83 suppose 19th century discovered ha d faster productivity growth would said go dig gold fa ster rate thing inherent objective price stability tr ying pu rchasing power money says favorable supply shock raise money growth objectives there’s reason cut money growth targets adverse supply shock wouldn’t i’m sure back 1970s 1980s didn’t argue lowering targets want vi ew transitory effects acceleration productivity gr owth lower reported rate flation transitory decline price level increase purchasing power money would onetime decline price leveli don’t want use “D” word supply shock goes away would return toward sort balan ced equilibrium would also I don’t see follows leaving th e money growth ranges alone communicates important reduced weight give need change say paying atten tion changing mean don’t pay attention MR WHITESELL perhaps I respond I think absolutely right case temporary supply shoc k would expect concept longrun steady state condition altered transitory supply s hock temporary increases productivity fact belie ve productivity growth surge experienced last four years tr ansitory going go away soon would reason alter longrun price stabi lity however believe permanent component increases produ ctivity I think people presumably would altering expected steady state growth nominal GDP believe need 84 comparable growth rates say M2 expected steady st ate growth nominal GDP accommodate kind steady state expa nsion presumably would want adjusting longrun ra nge aggregate MR JORDAN part I questioning linkage saying adjust nominal growth GDP; it’s sort nomin al spending effect point I getting yesterday regard dave stockton’s simulation clear ought explicit rather implicitly saying want monetary policy going “accommodative” nominal demand increases becau se real supplyside favorable development going le t’s also think implications symmetric matter ha ve surprising adverse supply shock would would say “let’s cut money growth targ ets” probably MR KOHN permanent nature certa inly

rates question steady state nominal GD P growth steady change rate growth productivity expected persist rather onetime change consistent bill said MR PRELL sense logic bei ng applied logic got current

call productivity I don’t know 85 ability know experiencing ny given time allows us make judgment committee certainly 1970s MR KOHN late right I think certain extent observe going see things like oil sh ocks dollar appreciation depreciation excise taxes whatever might change price level see ongoing change productivity I agree takes time recognize committee struggling last several years en four years since app ears retrospect productivity growth changed I think true changing ranges would saying best guess bill said permanen t component change productivity r eevaluate annual basis CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN isn’t issue re little limited effect best I judge assu ming longterm M2 velocity flat effectively engaged estimating longterm nomi nal GDP issue ifand I underline word “if”price stabi lity goal defined falls specific range central tendency M2 strikes question whether bad prices declining words hold contex t rising productivity rising real growththat keep nominal samewe get declining longterm prices different issue I think that’s legitimate question asking comes strictly questi goal long run stipulated assume stable velocity ssue imp licit M2 projection I don’t think complex I don’ t disagree word said I don’t disagree word opponents said th debate either I raise question: really problem 86 MR MEYER I think issue this: goal stable mone y growth stable inflation goal stable money growt h you’ll take whatever inflation comes depending upon productivity shocks CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN may okay MR MEYER may okay goal I understand operate mandate achieving price stabi lity I think indicate s necessarily zero inflation least stable inflation ra te make choice MR WHITESELL chairman menti oned given midpoint existing range 3 percent ta ke estimate potential put plus measurement bias implying nominal GDP 4 percent consistent price stability means aiming deflation 1 percent per year MR JORDAN I agree that’s arithm etic implication start period price stability started price stability later found acceleration productivity gr owth would one thing acceleration pr oductivity growth we’ve st arted positive rate inflation somehow measured means deceleration inherited rate something moving toward price stability juncture t oday concerns like registered yest erday staff others I would afraid message changing th e ranges would convey rather th communicating going put emphasis achieving higher rate growth would seem say willing accommodative accel eration inflation could say accommodati ng faster productivity growth I might even persuaded 87 right thing I think message woul d heard accommodating faster inflation CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN suppose say exp licitly issue say trying fi nd range price st ability e nvisage potential growth risen therefore things equal ranges shoul d go objective remains several years ago MR JORDAN I sure credib ility say believed; I I know people wouldn’t believe I said CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN I don’t believe seri ousness I thinkand I may wrong thisthat extent ra ise question capacity minutes humphreyhawkins report speeches make say essentially nothing changedthat fundamentally goal price stability potential risen necessity unless change income velocity money supply goals different said it’s arithmetical truism MR MEYER I think eas y attribute adjustment range productivity nobody actually believes goal setting range pure price stability nobody believes goal price stabil ity view people think accommodating higher inflation raise range CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN president parry MR PARRY question related mu ch discussion going alternative II I think said mi dpoint 4 percent M2 consistent shift productivity al goal price stability po tential output growth would 4 percent area price st ability would defined zero inflation I guess 88 troubling nominal GDP 4 percent means goal zero GDP deflator went around table nobody would give number MR WHITESELL i’m sure answers question suggesting 312 percent potenti al growth observed MR PARRY oh I see MR WHITESELL plus ½ percent asurement bias words measured GDP deflator would ½ percen t true inflation would zero MR PARRY well th e group happy i’m really happy MR KOHN that’s way ranges constructed last five years reasoning arithmetic mind committee might want think whether wants change cons istent committee MR PARRY okay CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN president poole MR POOLE I think explicit numbers involved would good thing us suppose say longterm goal 1 percent deflator estimate 4 percent real growth potential adds 5 percent would right I fear ever without explicit inflation goal people read th 5 percentgiven prices creeping bit pressures sideas indicating going accommodate somewhat higher inflation message would giving would fear explicit 89 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN clearly side question people read accommodating inflation th en argument moving I think unambiguous point ma y case problem MR POOLE well I said wi lling ex plicit longrun inflation target wh estimate potential growth I think make argument I believe i’ve said I think much explicit inflation target view would constructive CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN ar e essentially saying pric e stability goal want numerical judg ment price stability issue MR POOLE yes given i’ll call “revealed preference” way actually behaving I think market believes perfectly satisfied inflation rate somewhere neighborhood right that’s little I would regard ze ro inflation properly measured taking account biases indices best guess something like 112 percent CPI 1 percent deflator taking account measur ement biases pretty good estimate zero inflation really somewhat right I think market believes quite happy somewhat evidenced revealed preference terms decisions made CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN governor gramlich MR GRAMLICH I bought changing ranges I reluctance given discussion ar e suppose raise ranges M2 M3 point tell would say debt would reason changing debt range reduced federal debt 90 MR WHITESELL ne ver interpreted debt range longrun price stability range could move interpretation debt well thought desirable make inte rpretation three ra nges consistent make longrun price stability ra nges wanted could debt range match M2 long periods time debt grown rates comparable nominal GDP growth take decline debt velocity 1980s seriously think experience could re peated future might l eave debt range

nominal anc hor long run I think key thing agains t background I would prefer stay thing bothers little I certainly sense increase trend productivity growth I uncer tain transitory exactly magnitude I don’t think argument ab solutely ironclad go route try explain way going nvolve taking positions things I quite ready take position yet I don’t see particular reason CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN president guynn 91 MR GUYNN I would like join bill po ole al broaddus comments heard I see considerable merit moving direc tion explicit inflation target I don’t know whethe r going talk th morning particularly

president hoenig MR HOENIG mr chairman changing thes e ranges always dicey issue days matter say interpre tations reality time I could talked I think building consensus rising trend productivity improvements real f act willing accept thatand may moving targets make sense terms consistency w ith price stability I agree jerry jordan saying might re acted productivity shocks earlier period s I think things little different balance I could come favor raising ranges CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN president minehan MS MINEHAN thank mr chairman I want go back question portion discussion page 20 bluebook

MR WHITESELL currently it’s 3 percent MS MINEHAN much upward revi sion result change NIPA numbers MR WHITESELL much actually part staff’s current estimate potential output growth mi d1990sthrough second quarter 1995is still 214 percent current estimate last four years contrast 312 percent; 4 percent going forward en ratcheting potential output growth estimates structural producti vity th e second quarter 1995 moved 214 314 percent beginning 1998 pot ential output 334 percent beginning year we’ve predicted 4 percent MS MINEHAN mid1990s potential output growth somewhere around 214 212 percent full percentage point higher MR WHITESELL estimate still second quarter 1995 potential output growth 21 4 percent starting year 134 percentage points higher 4 percent MS MINEHAN yes MR PRELL case we’ve done li ttle extrapolate recent experience nearterm period thinking might want adjusted ranges one question would assu mption potential GDP growth would want rest assumption th e experience past year swhere behavior unemployment rate relative GDP example would seem consistent potential output 93 growth somewhere 312 percent range li ttle higher would want look forward optimistic way assumption 4 percent MS MINEHAN I understand exactly want I trying get handle effect NIPA revisions I knew effecta tenths percentage pointfrom NIPA revisions MR PRELL A tenths came change MS MINEHAN i’m thinking bout communications issue MR PRELL sure MS MINEHAN portion produc tivity change really fallout revising numbers better way presumably re sult NIPA changes something would help

chairman I walked really quite agnostic issue I know matter people feel strongly I interested hearing sides I come conclusion perhaps better course leave well enough alonenot make change stage variety reasons jack 95 guynn raised one reason import ant course year I suspect fair amount scrutiny core policy matters I would prefer go period explain m onetary aggregate issues frankly terribly important us right secondly whole ssue also come numerical inflation targeting I happen one think qualitative inflation target served us well I see reason open debate I think would course reaching de cision change ranges third thing worries I listen conversation also force us sense explicit committee view s productivity productivity trend i’m sure I hearing consistency among committee members issues finally I believe lesson learned central bank colleagues around world positio n talk defend actions visàvis happening growth monetary aggregates particular ECB put weight money grow th perhaps s hould lambasted week week newspapers allowing M3 gr owth target I think much better position clearly said putting much weight aggregates M3 grow th may may targets I frankly prefer quite clear comm

wise remarks CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN governor meyer MR MEYER well different perspe ctive I suppose I must say interesting discussion far I think identified two issues relevant target ranges first whether revise th em reflect faster rate growth trend GDP second implicit inflation ta rget use set midpoint revised range alternative II deals first issu e I believe perpetuates possible misunderstanding inflation target pure price stability adjusted estimate inflation bias I say possible misunderstanding committee fully discussed preferred inflation rate certainly hasn’t worked achieve consensus point strict price stability target th implicit targ et range today might ask question: really make us look like central ba nk focused price stability around world like th e central bank least tr ansparent inflation objective I think latter I offer alternative III set ranges th incorporates view implicit inflation target set midpoint M2 growth rate reflec t i’ve called price stability plus cushion although remains lot uncertainty abou t precise value trend GDP growth might evolve next several years I think current monetary growth ranges outdated badly need revision I comfortable judgment reflected alternat ive II ranges updated reflect assumption trend GDP growth currently 312 per cent humphreyhaw kins report testimony 97 emphasize FOMC reconsider setting monetary aggregate ranges incoming information leads us revise estimate trend real GDP growth instead thinking monetary growth ranges carved stone use digitalsubject costless adjustments response flow new information let turn second issue undoubtedly controversial one I think sending implicit message define price stability set ranges try escape reality I doubt successful change ranges many people already indica ted may result probing implicit inflation target clearly go exerci se explicitly set ranges question present th e public: blur l ogic ignore issue entirely transparent I think mainand maybe onlyp urpose monetary aggregate ranges today means offer implicit inflation target perhaps view today’s discussion ra nges opportunity ternal discussion set inflation target consistent interpretation price stability might also look discussion decision toda y opportunity another step direction transparency I want point view subtle real difference “explicit inflation target” “inflation targeting” I understand central bank conduct monetary policy achie ve price stability without esta blishing inflation target consistent interpretati price stability given want markets help us achieve target also value bei ng explicit I believe I accept explicit inflation target without sign specific strategy achieving I interpret “infla tion targeting” 98 countries pr ice stability mandates expl icit numerical targets uniformly set ranges centered i’ve referred price stability plus cushion view appropriate option light concern deteri oration cyclical performance near zero inflation w ith zero nominal interest rate valve therefore I offer alternative III range centered preferred midpoint 5 percent reflects sum 312 percent rate tr end growth GDP ½ percentage po int estimate bias chain measure price index GDP 1 perc entage point cushion suggests 3 percent 7 percent range would small step take toward explicit inflation target enhanced transparency would big step committee take I give

attaching symm etric range central tende ncy would yield range 2 7 percent M2 analogous aust ralian approach setting “thick” point target 2 3 percent problems par ticularly indecision onc e M2 growth inside central range would allow us de fer precise setti ng midpoint consensus could reached committee perhaps consultation congress CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN president moskow MR MOSKOW thank mr chairman th interesting discussion practical standpoint I come back exactly place I last 11 times I discussed d make change ranges I think would mi sleading public us make change unless 99 huge education program front others said change would give impression placing lot weight ranges formulation monetary policy aren’t I think communications challenges significantnot surmountable significantbecause lot people don’t accept th e premise economy’s potential growth rate high many people ar ound table think da ys we’d explain well; otherwise people ar e going think moving thes e ranges indicates going conducting monetary policy way w ould view inflationary finally inflation target issue question real ly whether quantitative inflation target important issue I think one discussed view discusse d separately context monetary policy ranges something reasonable people obviously disagree disagreement around table I believe important discuss I really think calls separate discussion entirely CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN president stern MR STERN thank mr chairman well I don’t lot add many people already observed ha ve discussed case unlike previous discussions I think today bot h arithmetically substantively case raising ranges pretty strong I don’t feel strongly I think communications challenge said guess communications challenge dealt I think market participants wo uld get message pretty directly used vehicles available us bu t guess judgme nt I could wrong I don’t feel str ongly raising ranges CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN president boehne 100 MR BOEHNE governor ferguson capture d views nearly

permanent higher rate grow th perceive permanent I think ought move alternative II I note concept sustainable growth shifted meaningfully past several years seems could well shift possibly either

sa y argument basically twofold one general rule environment like last tightening move make going mistake know time almost invariably mistake tighten small cremental doses size mistake smaller definition secondly far importantly I think la test evaluation equity premium stock market downrig ht scary I haven’t se en anything like fact use inflated earnings expectations securi ty analysts PE ratios get extremely impressive equity premium back 1987 recall longterm rates going stock market went market ran steam far worse situation I concerned aggressive process ti ghtening could crack market end severe proble m instability I don't know far go indeed I don't know long continue tightening 25 basis points sort working hypothesis I w ould argue think terms moving every meeting move 25 basis point crements would continue course unless appears getti ng behind curve inflation inflation expectations case would raise size adju stment hand could continue implement strategy gan see wealth effect stabilizing andor gap supply demand beginning cl ose unless happens remain unusual period ne ver experienced I arguing something coming particular simula tion needed argument 127 valid best I judge wealth effect th market extremely high valuation levels take action close supplydemand gap I would propose therefore move funds rate 25 basis points today include press release equivalent used call asymmetry would full expectation movi ng march turns economic expansion accelerating indeed I every reason susp ect may woul d policy issue view ought looking looking underlying inflation pressures economy become larger I think move faster today I think appropriate move 25 basis points issue asymmetric statementi don't remember exact language plan use express VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH “balance risks” CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN balance risks toward inflation vice chair VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOU GH mr chairman I fully support recommendation let make comments issue clearly whether nothing whether fi rm 25 basis points 50 basis poi nts I agree either case would use balance risks language indica ting concerned inflation I think look reality perceived everywhere around world best central bank busi ness highly regarded highly respected commitment price stability certainly defined speeches testimony I think unquestioned nywhere style th strong silent leader one moves incrementally move 25 basis points time systematic way move 50 basis pointsto continue analogy al l sudden strong silent leader starts beating chest show tough guy iswhat would 128 conclusion I believe would scared frightened certainly go business rmal way continuing exhibit confidence earned performance I th ink thing contribute stabilizing economy I agree fully working hypothesis series tightening moves approp riate I believe background thinking I feel st rongly 25 basis points combined balance risks statement toward inflation concer ns far right package today thank CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN president poole MR POOLE mr chairman I certainly also support recommendation faced powerful real forces want allow run extent terms increasing productivity employment real income without ups etting inflationary apple cart I would like rela te comments morning discussion yesterday trade deficit trade deficit also part real adjustment going economy fundamentally nominal phe nomenon trade deficit financing capital flows coming country beca use rate return high cannot object policy cause determined re al forces unusual certainly context postwar US histor y perhaps much back I think move 25 basis points statem ent balance risks toward inflation exactly right way go ma rket friend market anticipated move saw interest rates rise federal funds futures prediction market four weeks anything th leaves market wondering go 50 basis points balanced risk 129 statement markets would likely say concluded done certainly conclusion want make market much work possible lead way help us figure wh correct respons e incoming flow information I absolutely ag ree likely m ean sequence 25 basis point increases meeting wouldn’t correct say dave stockton's famous language “as far eye see” nevertheless fo r quite time working cooperatively market I think best ch ance coming without big upset I support recommendation 100 percent CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN president parry MR PARRY mr chairman I would prefer 50 basis point increase funds rate also public statement focusing heightened inflation ri sk future concern time period tween meeting next meeting march 21st quite long I might suggest something would make comf ortable 25 basis point increase agree assess s ituation end month considerably data certainly data prices coul d review data see feel time move appropriate I don't see constrained fixed calendar case involves quite long interval meetings 14 years I fed found telephone meetings times like usef ul perspective thou gh it’s certainly one shared everyone would reduce possibility get behind curve CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN option telephone conference always table always it’s needed employ obviously 130 MR PARRY well I think mi ght case time CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN markets tell us president stern MR STERN thank mr chairman I support recommendation entirety seems give n kind technology productivity shock real interest rates need rise extent occurred judgment need go I see way accomplish raising funds rate ¼ point increase certainly accepta ble I would go beyond aggressive principally considerations uncertainty seems uncertain future path productivity uncertain NAIRU I personally uncertain whether latter useful c oncept uncertain implications increase real rates already occurred wh effects may turn I think suggesting ought CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN president hoenig MR HOENIG mr chairman I support proposal completely I believe increased risk inflation I think ought say also I much favor 25 basis points several reasons first models show direct ion I agree don’t show precision I think shoul d proceed gradually secondly environment core inflation modest need recognize begin pave way higher rates th irdly imbalances remain trying take account don’t want shock system either I think continuing steady path appropriate approach therefore I support recommendation CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN governor meyer 131 MR MEYER thank mr chairman I support recommendation 25 basis point increase funds rate I continue call asymmetric posture I also agree likely implement series tight enings year; likely appropriate ma ke move meeting period time given uncertainties trend growt h NAIRU inflation dynamics also given uncertainty impact policie s financial conditions br oadly I think strong case gradualist approach I hope able use bias announcement accompanies today’s action skillfully I mean I hope don't undermine I view sensible expectations rise funds rate built term structure futures markets lot discussion today un certainty st ructure economy inflation dynamics value humility I don’t want lead discussion opposed humility laughter however I think sometimes draw implication humility suggests inaction though certa inly arguing mr chairman I want bring us back discussion monetary growth targets seems monetary growth target regime danger inaction much less funds rate regime I think c onsistent points president jordan making productivity growth little higher end little lower inflation; somewhat limited won't much problem interest rate regime inaction dangerousand pa rticularly dangerous expansion driven higher productivity raises real equilibrium interest rates I also want comment bit discussi role wealth effect clearly important go productivity upturn wealth effect 132 consumption excess demand growth relati ve supply growth we’ve lot discussion number arenas declining equity premium higher equilibrium growth rate raise valu e equity prices A lot partial equilibrium analysis plug formula low equity premium voilàhigher equity prices makes little sense general equilibrium model model wealth effect ultimately genera te increases real interest rates significantly cap diminish increase equity premiums I think danger facing recently monetary policy somewhat slow tighten allo wed economy opera te partial equilibrium world I think going see equity prices evolve general equilibrium world I think one reason bit cautious gradualist I want make comments I perceive consensus strategy unfolding seems talki ng preemptive slowing economy trend growth reactive get trend growth stabilized unemployment rate point prepared reactive respond evidence higher inflation I struggling issue whether appropriate strate gy perhaps even optimal strategy given uncertainty output gap sensible strategy I thi nk gaps details fill obviously decide appropriate path funds rate slow economy trend also keep mind unsuccessful slowing economy trend th erefore output gap rises even affect policy tighten otherwise would tighten enough slow economy trend th push output gap back I 133 think consistent nonlinear rule I discusse d past uncertain output gap uncertainty bout whether beyond economy’s potential diminishes greatly outpu t gap increases based best estimate potential third issue I think going ha ve focus strategy aggressively move higher flation extent weighted response increase s output gap inflati rises aggressive would otherwise way think th get trend growth unemployment rate stabilizes assumed policy setting strategy consistent stable inflation output gap ba sically zero inflation begins rise respond increase inflati way ordinarily would also revise estimate output gap th requires aggressive response inflation w ould otherwise case thoughts leas t shape views strategy going forward CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN governor ferguson MR FERGUSON thank mr chairman I agree halves recommendation I think reinforce mark ets right I think right expectations secondly I like ot moved uncer tainties talked I also recognize th inflation appear stage verge virulent outbreak move 25 basis points seems m oderate appropriate I think you're absolutely right suggesting time continue look reaction markets generally including asse t markets I think I said yesterday 134 likely underlying turbulen ce finally outl ook sentence I believe statement suggests risks balanced ward inflation obviousl y right one use take back things we're CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN president boehne MR BOEHNE I agree recommendati ¼ point I think need convey view tightening ahead us best guess significant amount tightening coming year may well tim e series tightening moves move ½ point going appropriate today I think ¼ right basic product one confiden ceconfidence we're going appropriate keep economy right path today's environment 25 basis point increase funds rate captures indicates yes know tightening appropriate we're going needs done neither going underreact overreact I think impor tant image strong confident central bank public deserves put confidence CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN president broaddus MR BROADDUS mr chairman I pretty much bob parry tough call I druthers preference would go full ½ point would decisive move would preempt infla tion expectations mi ght either building likely build nearterm future I reco gnize would strong move particularly context need asymmetry whatever do; I agree fully point score I recognize risks big risk might get market break could lead I would refer di sorderly plunge stock market would complicate situation make difficult fo r us take kind steps need 135 take I able accept ¼ point increa se morning I would hope I might call “asymmetry plus” need language also I would hopeand I expect you’d inclined test imony far roadthat underscore intensity ar e watching developments readiness move aggressively f act need also I hope line I would hope board governors might c onsider complementary discount rate increase near future furthermore I agree bob parry I know intermeeting conference call always table context remarks I hope watch market developments carefully signal call CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN governor gramlich MR GRAMLICH first data point: I talked yesterday difference tenyear bonds nominal real spread I match developing synthetic yield CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN I didn't colleagues end table MR GRAMLICH I using chart E xhibit 18 st aff sends around every monday rendering certai nly last month rise inflation premium don kohn persuade I way overstated yesterday nevertheless gone second thing I would like say I tend agree bluebook simulations inflation targeting humble models I believe likely need lot tightening real question deal today get 136 I support recommendation 25 basi s point move tilt implicit gradualism I recognize benefi ts strategy i'm delight ed thought strong silent leader laughter I think ma ke good point mr chairman economy many ways fragile things could chan ge rather abruptly past record good calling turns therefore chance could overreact regard I thought tilt connection roger ferguson’s working group one thing I like til t easily revers ible raise rate 50 basis points discovered much re duced 25 basis points would look though didn’t know 25 basis points tilt new data come indicating economy stro ng thought take tilt looks know we're we're looking data that’s nice advantage tilt i’m glad using situation ar e number benefits gradualism strategy I recognize th I support recommendation said costs gradualism strategy could moving little late historical precedent I think ought keep mind CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN president jordan MR JORDAN thank I look financial markets tellingly meor maybe importantly tell ingly mei see treasury yield curve upward sloping bit two years five years beyond five years it’s downward sloping corporate bond yields mortgage rates 8 percent I would hard pressed say wrong levels environment outlined gree nbook associated expectations I would feel much firmer gr ound saying something wrong 137 market levels given secondhalf experience 534 percent real growth depending inflation measure nominal spen ding 712 8 percent I thought didn’t add says market building ki nd real growth plus inflation inherited second half last year year I don’t know nominal interest rates need go inflation turn dversely accelerate seems built marketplace right inflation expectations beginning rise I think would undesi rable real rates go I would think nominal rates would need increase front end curve though I look rise rates securities maturing two years leave w ith feeling 512 percent overnight interbank rate low consistent closing gap somewh would wisest thing taking step t oday I think appropriate I comment though question 50 basis points versus 25 basis points requires make reference discount rate time I think still case movement funds ra te accompanying increase discount rate interpreted lasting move opposed move funds rate alone given I would think 50 basis point increase funds rate discount rate change strong since I cons ider directors’ recommendations discount rate increase appropriate environment I would prefer ¼ point funds rate knowing accompanied discount rate move fact I would oppose 50 basis point change funds rate either discount rate increase without CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN board go vernors meeting later vote discount rate president guynn 138 MR GUYNN thank mr chairman I came meeting intention inclination argue 50 basis point ti ghtening I think staff presentations heard yesterday comments made around table would certainly s upport I believe evidence mounting infl ationary pressures probability inflation moving clearly increased view biggest worry consen sus go 50 basis point tightening would inclination slide back balanced risk statement eloquently pointed want I support ¼ point tighteni ng today balance risks side inflationary pressures I guess already answered question let say I would really like see boar d consider discount rate incr ease I think gives directors ownership policy action reinforces action taking view reasonably high probability step pace terms policy actions meetings come I support recommendation CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN president moskow MR MOSKOW thank mr chairman table today’s wall street journal I don’t know many people saw listed series possible fed actions today gave odds likely market reaction different scenarios we’ve talk aboutan increase th e funds rate 25 50 basis poi nts tilt without last line th e table rate cut fed odds “as likely cubs winning world series” laughter A nd likely market reaction “holy cow” laughter I found upsetting obvious ly chance going lower rates today cubs fans always optimistic 139 mr chairman I support recommendation ve ry strongly I th ink strategy incremental moves excellent one supporting markets right helping confirm inclinations seems clear move today would jeopardize expansion would also jeopardize credibility well important I note outlook assumes fed funds path decidedly upward drift forecast horizon A nd even strong upward tilt project deterioration inflation outlook regardle ss whether look core PCE core CPI measures I mentioned yesterday inflat ion still going judgment increase 25 basis points going enough forecast horizon I believe said thinking series moves make sure correct imbalance aggregate demand aggregate supply I think it’s also important say balance risks tilt ed higher inflation exactly reasons explained articulately CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN president minehan MS MINEHAN thank mr chairman one thing I came meeting determined end asymmetric directive whether went 25 50 basis point increase funds rate i’m glad appears th going I imagine people gave thought wh I might recommend meeting would thought I would clearly side 50 basis point move I must admit i’m frequent debate s much demand side equationi don’t think anybody doubts strength demandbut elements supply richly portrayed don kohn’s different graphs i’m becoming much believer view potential produc tivity stay flat current high level 140 grow future better I thought I don’ t know NAIRU forecast forecasts we’ve ing boston require great deal jiggering done try capture bit th e uncertainty I know I feel people apparently feel supply side I also think interacti markets presents us series risks talk ed I tried incorporate discussion yesterday respect buildup imbalances terms credit related rising asset values two thi ngs mind sense risk sense uncertainty economy’s actual capacity i’m comfor table move 25 basis points CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN governor kelley MR KELLEY mr chairman I support recommendation reasons expressed I think it’s exactly right thing I want say I feel good deal identification th e remarks president broaddus others around table CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN president mcteer MR MCTEER I support parts r
