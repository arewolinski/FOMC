assessment look steadiness productivity gain last year ongoing acceleration one attribute much cyclical element productivity performance I think perhaps average private forecaster MS minehan also rather interesting though forecast assume much less tighten average tighten forecast somewhere 25 50 basis point something order 75 100 basis point less term growth MR PRELL I do n’t enough information individual forecast able analyze difference I think productivity assumption difference part story propel permanent income growth high affect stock market forecastsmacro advisor example explicit piecesare still anticipate decline stock price instance I think forecast analysis investment take account large component replacement investment investment forecast I believe consensus housing we be strong consensus we have consensus partly analysis good backlog order wealth effect might significant think condition still place element private final demand little strong picture somewhat strong view underlie fundamental many instance folk rise stock price still weak demand it be hard chairman GREENSPAN that be inconsistent32 MR PRELL one different coefficient different view wealth effect one attribute less strength consumption demand normal wealth effect spate mortgage refinance last year erratic element recognize crowd hard press give analysis come conclusion materially lower point MR MEYER could I give interpretation staff somewhat different perspective private forecast I think main difference staff strong view interaction supply demand common force productivity affect demand supply I think prove accurate one do n’t see perspective private forecast forecaster revise productivity growth estimate get demand impact change whole dynamic chairman GREENSPAN I think exactly right fact risk staff forecast may well side probability forecast low mean negligible MR PRELL I might say term sign strong demand receive preliminary read january auto sale seem come almost 18 million units179 millionfor light vehicle well rate anticipate first quarter combination construction datum morning mean we have two piece much strong spend datum build greenbook forecast chairman GREENSPAN president jordan33 MR jordan thank I question international side I may question dave stockton ’s presentation simulation chart 15 first karen chart 10 : I think kind simulation interesting I want get say bit scenario might least consistent exercise go see lot reference idea united state become debtor nation external liability grow I have probably even talk way occasion know lot holding foreigner source capital inflowsthe counterpart large maybe grow current account deficitconsist asset perspective foreign investor denominate dollar may think debt asset holding literally dollar I would assume way account do last year foreigner increase holding US currency 30 billionor whatever number count part debt would part finance go MS JOHNSON balance payment statistic log way huge number yes count debt MR jordan get pretty big depend rest world regard socalle dollarization could get quite large I do n’t know much russians alone acquire last year dollardenominate asset foreigner hold whether cd type deposit bank mutual fund debt security equity kind investment vehiclesare count part debt part sense really debt buy uncle sam be debt debt instrument government corporation united state debt whether hold domestic foreign investors34 appropriately extent receive end basis anecdotal report increase volume direct foreign investment kindsacquisition company include example supermarket chain banking chain may increase suppose superimpose simulation two extreme : 1 increase foreign holding dollardenominate asset really uncle sam be debt 2 extreme equity investment portfolio investment direct investment kind would draw different conclusion implication exchange rate dollar MS JOHNSON read step truly piece paper MR jordan I know MS JOHNSON step notion number get large would inevitably consequence people ’s willingness hold dollar would produce 25 percent devaluation 5 percent devaluation whatever analysis I model I able rely work one side process say : dollar x y would implication current account balance answer questionnot simulation draw react I think goingi would say true capital account important piece story desire foreigner invest united state participate gain productivity development occur united state I think lie behind development see evident fact much time deficit wideningover past three year let we saythe dollar rise mean capital account go direction time current account go way might lead one take comfort notion people35 find attractive instrument buy united state believe asset valuation US financial market sound reason think go change hurry time take face value open gap GDP gnp big deal although I imagine politician make lot noise principle nothing economic gap GDP gnp would troublesome could well imagine world make rational appropriate allocation global saving major economy productivity high elsewhere capital ought accumulate capital own foreigner own resident united state problem could continue time I do n’t think anything form foreign investment takeswhether portfolio direct investmentsthat necessarily assure continue that be foreigner reasonpolitical economic rational irrationalto decide unhappy exposure US economy would avail financial instrument either decrease exposure hedge one readily hedge foreign direct investment sell financial asset short view protect oneself certain kind exchange rate development certain kind economic development case form capital enter united state necessarily imply anything future behavior I put forward warn flagi do n’t deny thati think necessarily imply dollar come pressure tomorrow next day next year I would also say nothing automatic form capital inflow work future change investor sentiment toward hold claim united states36 MR jordan okay I accept thatand nothing simulation suggest change imminent let come question slightly different way I be try understand well let we start panel lower leave exercise involve assumption dollar devalue 25 percent first reaction say " okay that be useful exercise go through " I start think fact dollar decline 25 percent value time period currency would rise 25 percent dollar I ca n’t imagine currency might actually happen MS JOHNSON I 'll submit euro I guess I 'll throw laughter MR jordan you 'll never convince chairman GREENSPAN cuban peso laughter MS JOHNSON think problem japanese economy confront I be personally quite pessimistic japan I do n't think anything positive go happen time soon people buy japanese equity clearly feel differently feel people put upward pressure yen feel differently japanese economy might appear restructure recover might appear offer return road quite attractive nonetheless japanese current account surplus mean exchange rate interest rate japanese investor persuade acquire net claim rest world every monthno matter whatgoe forward daunt think one might well believe go hard japanese economy begin recover MR jordan maybe japanese ricardian let ask dave stockton question chart 15 I may interesting scenario get back I think to37 governor meyer ’s comment simulation difference forecast model staff ’s model scenario 1 staff ’s model would n’t case least partial analysis give acceleration productivity correspond increase real GDP growth would deceleration inherit rate inflation correspond extent occur would haveand I guess model require thisan acceleration nominal spend say do n’t get productivity gain lower price level timea lower rate inflation ongoing basis rather produce increase final demand increase demand finance implicit accommodative policy part either money growth accelerate credit come along finance great spend velocity must change happen make thing come together MR STOCKTON fact underlie assumption monetary policy accommodate stepup nominal GDP would increase money growth go along obviously shortrun scenario I think simulation present bluebook try give flavor case midst acceleration productivity equilibrium real fund rate go along effect say could hold another two year experience period unemployment rate decline even inflation rate basically stay end two year need ultimately sense fund rate entire structure interest rate move high long term order sustain low inflation MR jordan okay butand I think important pointthe simulation allow real interest rate move equilibrium level do n't let the38 inflation rate come way model work do n’t get automatic increase real rate would come along deceleration inflation therefore real rate rise future get thing back balance MR STOCKTON constant federal fund rate scenario small increase real federal fund rate slightly lower inflation rate point exactly correct MR jordan okay thank chairman GREENSPAN president parry MR PARRY karen I question japan recently finance ministry indicate might borrow 21 percent oppose issue 10year bond would cost 16 percent I question I try sound objective ask first astute financial strategy give finance second chapter 2 speak capital injection banking system would suggest perhaps bank really turn corner japan I must admit seem reallyto use neutral term“intereste " time longterm postal saving deposit come due renew 25 percent finance ministry go borrow bank narrow private group 21 percent seem would cause tremendous political problem MS JOHNSON information I new york time article I read talk among staff try figure various hypothesis understand go though I ca n't distinguish among I put particular stew fact bank japan announce busy sell bill market short run absorb excess39 liquidity ministry finance say try mobilize fund view sit around banking system nothing have n't admit sort approach credit crunch situation see fund sit go utilize resource propose borrow provide local government fund obligate provide budget provision already exist essence borrow banking system finance right alternative presumably would issue japanese government bond jgbs one might imagine bank would take idle fund provide buy jgbs 4 basis point MR PARRY right MS JOHNSON one possibility way give bank bit income one might ask I whether ministry finance think relatively attractive instrument bank provide finance would direct JGB route say do sense ministry finance go able expand amount finance oneforone swap appear book effect policy implication ministry finance might actually less finance open market consequence issue instrument particularly attractive bank thereby increase willingness bank hold claim japanese government case ministry could say yes pay bit actually sell market JGB market would otherwiseif sell much sell nothing else go onthis crazy scheme point view ministry finance I guess40 a couple thing worry one seem odd bank japan another concern jgbs sit go sell enormous capital loss japanese longterm rate really move end banking system put large amount capital barely get effect banking system fix mean economy recover deal cycle debt create undercut process put capital loss book japanese bank instrument presumably wo n't trading market ; wo n't mark market wo n't show capital loss least wo n't show time soon go sell rate market anyway may way try improve bank balance sheetsa way give return 2 percent instead 2 basis pointsbecause go need 41 MR PARRY thank chairman GREENSPAN president stern MR STERN thank I question simulation well mike greenbook show baseline simulation flat fund rate simulation I look analysis seem imply sacrifice ratio one bluebook sacrifice ratio much worse I try understand cause difference different assumption credibility expectation form I do n't know MR KOHN different time period sacrifice ratio bluebook calculate full ten year lag work might different short run long run MR STERN really involve difference 8 percentage point 1 difference unemployment rate 7 difference PCE price number MR PRELL short run exchange rate dynamic exaggerate response that be probably important element get effect big MR STERN right let ask bluebook sacrifice ratio I do n’t know credibility assumption seem really high MR KOHN little high we have past much consistent model look long run fairly high sacrifice ratio I think compare model bound baseline simulation next two year 1 percent plus NAIRU gap small upward creep inflation imply pretty high sacrifice ratio that be great unemployment rate NAIRU do n’t result much upward creep inflation obviously want lower inflation lot NAIRU long time get inflation to42 come sacrifice ratio intend consistent basic story greenbook term fast inflation would accelerate next year give assume output gap it be important recognize lot thing go greenbook scenario price shock oil price move forth analysis try abstract get underlie slope phillip curve MR PRELL one thing point repeatedly model simulation output path generate different stock market assumption versus different monetary policy assumption much large expectational effect monetary policy case quite plausible fed perceive nothing face decline unemployment rate acceleration price people 's inflation expectation would mark considerably change expectation would exaggerate effect kind scenario generate significant decline dollar exchange market exacerbate inflationary effect chairman GREENSPAN president poole MR POOLE I want go back chart 10 karen look though assume exogenous change endogenous variable that be something I spend 30 year try tell student MS JOHNSON I use partial equilibrium model it be okay laughter MR POOLE I be speechless laughter MS JOHNSON nothing simulation intend suggest dollar would react cause change dollar simply statement say : foreign growth US growth potential good know the43 dollar follow path would outcome current recovery nothing mean predictive drive dollar MR POOLE I guess question be : one learn experiment nature it be partial equilibrium involve whole lot thing do n't add model internally inconsistent MS JOHNSON I think one learn analysis believe return strong vigorous growth abroad solve external balance problem united state mistake unless parameter relate trade near term determinant change lot change soon case resumption foreign growth effect close US external gap MR PRELL contradict degree I say early comparison various forecast look outside forecast many net export balance reach nadir sometime yeareither flatten turn kind pattern able understand give analysis elasticity involve yet people still seem notion mind strength foreign economy result import elasticity be n’t strong seem chairman GREENSPAN president hoenig MR HOENIG mike dave respect simulation let ask something I think hint around edge two three previous question greenbook prepare last time december meet assume increase 75 basis point fund rate work greenbook increase 125 basis point one look simulation analysis suggest behind curve44 unless scenario 1 occur let ask think odd scenario 1 materialize everything else suggest behind curve MR STOCKTON I sure I would characterize scenario 1 quite way characterize fact one could argueand I think may president jordan arguingthat scenario 1 fall behind curve sense even though inflation pick unemployment rate fall even equilibrium indeed real federal fund rate fall even longrun equilibrium scenario enjoy another period sustain strong economic growth low inflation still fair amount work do scenario 1 term adjust policy point road order bring fund rate back equilibrium inherit lower rate inflation go process certainly something benefit good news twoyear period still policy tighten do road fact longerrun bluebook simulation show term probability one judge probability scenario 1 staff forecast error recent year one might say entirely implausible laughter obviously think relatively balance set risk forecast see chart 14 recent observation show productivity still accelerate entirely clear probability split right middle scenario 1 scenario 2 MR HOENIG that be interesting thank MR MEYER could I follow judge probability might want indicate path investment would model produce capital45 deepen require achieve scenario give capital deepen generate uptick trend productivity MR STOCKTON true particular scenario fast productivity growth generate part rapid multifactor productivity growth we have there be addition capital deepen factor work MR PRELL underscore point I hope see prefomc briefing yesterday multifactor productivity trend pale comparison experience long period country 's economic history could well component well productivity performance MR MEYER yes that be almost pull something hat way seem big story increase capital deepen want play story I think need trace would need get much capital deepen produce acceleration productivity MR PRELL one think investment merely prelude put place efficient operation one might say payoff multifactor productivity still lie ahead one want new wave optimist certainly possible come story assumption generous feel reasonably balance scenario baseline forecast obviously far optimistic forecaster large yet think sensible look prospect chairman GREENSPAN interesting interplay karen say larry say strength dollar face widen current account deficit apparently consequence increase rate return facilities46 relate capital deepen relationship fairly strong least immediate forecast tie among simultaneous simulation lot thing occur pull one string whole thing unravels MR PRELL grab onto one string though possible buoyancy dollar something might argue bubble situation equity market people may exaggerate idea prospective return investment chairman GREENSPAN foreigner MR PRELL domestic foreign investor foreigner play role invest perceive profitable US venture chairman GREENSPAN shall break coffee get frozen vice chairman MCDONOUGH may I add one comment relate go back karen 's chart 10 great deal work current account deficit percentage GDP way work we have do drive notion give almost reasonable pattern one assume world economy current account deficit percentage GDP continue worsen one go deep concern sheer terror prospect question arise possibly do one come question like " what happen 25 percent devaluation " analysis do indicate continue worsen current account deficit inevitable ifrationally irrationally karen suggestedforeigner decide do n't want hold asset go back peter fisher 's presentation look happen euro everybody think wonderful

MR ferguson it be hard follow though I might say administrative governor I want find machine laughter staff I discuss later serious vein end last meet state would review incoming datum closely sign imbalance datum we have receive date suggest economy continue expand fast pace potential even potential go mike bring recent datum automobile sale strong recent ECI datum even though measurement flaw I understand suggest vigilance important similarly late information regard personal income outlay suggest consumer continue willing spend beyond income give credibility optimistic survey number also worry regard imbalance respect recent GDP number I think I well educate staff do independent analysis discover fact relatively agnostic number one suggest strengthen economy early discussion regard forecast regard I have like make two observation one staff expect shortfall earning widen corporate finance gap implicitly high volatility equity market well noticeably high interest rate suggest inconceivable expect return investment might weaken conjunction amount of70 investment might weaken lead one small internal inconsistency perhaps greenbook though I understand get similarly greenbook suggest significant increase short term interest rate also suggest spite equity market tread water sense end year pretty much level start year I grow concern placid surface may disguise underlie

economy hear discuss today probably hear course day I along other certainly think risk good economic performance primarily side equilibrium interest rate probably high current market rate however other suggest I think prepare move policy incrementally use tool carefully mind president boehne put correctly : goal attempt maintain maximum sustainable growth well try focus price stability I believe enter particularly challenge year economy may prove " interesting " sense chinese proverb thank chairman GREENSPAN governor gramlich MR gramlich thank mr chairman staff always serve we well I believe do particularly time I appreciate inflationtargete exercise do bluebook I think there be lot learn know I recently become interested approach monetary policy possible mean dealing71 policy age productivity shock I try put think word speech I give early month reaction around build interesting like inflation target ; say what be big deal already other say way ever I fortify consensus laughter unlike al broaddus I can not wait tomorrow talk bluebook laughter I find exciting I be go try draw three lesson exercise first lesson I think fairly obvious one since unemployment rate well structural estimate NAIRU incipient inflationary pressure pressure counteract fairly sharp early rise fund rate something I think we have less suspect staff exercise still valuable show high fund rate require stabilize inflationsomethe like 7 percent course assume model literally correct may want assume I think take note general point second lesson preemption good suspect staff exercise show inflationtargete fund rate rise another full percentage point wait see actual acceleration hence get behind curve wait lead large variation fund rate ounce prevention worth pound cure third point present circumstance reversal seem least relatively unlikely staff exercise assume NAIRU 4 percent none professional forecaster larry meyer recently survey paper prepare go low though 4 percent within normal statistical distribution estimate estimate recent paper brainard parry sake argument staff assume 4 percent right number work back optimal monetary policy72 still get fund rate rise 6 percent near future hence even make early tighten move oldfashione date view NAIRU probability seem relatively slight eat crow reverse move one could also inflation target I ’ll call pipeline method look price lead final good price PPI one measure rise rapidly third quarter pretty stable since actually decelerate late 1999 impact oil remove much true import price think bind rise point time seem relatively stable commodity price reverse downward movement begin trend even apart oil commodity future chairman often tell we single important number unit labor cost base combination wage cost productivity evidence still reassure recent ECI number suggest nonwage labor cost may trend still less increase labor productivity point unit labor cost rise less rapidly fact nearly stable chairman 's important number I think it be also reassure number pile datum get intermeete period outandout inflationary spiral rabbit wage increase beat turtle productivity increase every time far turtle ahead next let we look forecaster say blue chip forecaster actually pretty mellow individual average predict rise inflation either final good producer good predict increase interest rate seem inflation prediction base assume policy tighten presumably without tighten would predict acceleration michigan the73 philadelphia fed survey forecast price also rise slightly case it be impossible tell monetary policy forecast base it be hard read evidence let we look bond market evidence could I think worthy attention example interest rate 10year bond nominal real recently change noticeably year ago TIP real yield slightly 4 percent nominal yield 412 percent noticeably skittish bond market time build little inflation premium real yield go 43 percent even late drop nominal yield way 66 percent 10year bond bond market build pretty hefty inflation premium presumably due current inflation 23 percent soa major change last year potential undo flight quality around turn year may partially complicate analysis would treasury buyback program rise expectation inflation must prominent factor obvious implication inflation may return key economic phenomenon motivate bond market something I think none we would like happen watch inflationtargete perspective model bond market seem vote tighten forecaster hard read I think pipeline method signal abstention finally I would like look condition I 'll call equilibrium perspective stable growth economy inflation rate settle staff ’s target 2 percent term premium bond close zero real rate TIP bond allude 43 percent financial people think roughly 40 basis point liquidity premium TIP bond give thin market compare comparable nominal bond hence adjust real interest rate might 39 percent even with74 stable expectation 2 percent inflationan inflation rate would lucky achieve accord staffthe equilibrium level nominal shortterm rate order 59 percent stable growthstable inflation economy present rate bit south I think we view feel balance risk would like

far staff ’s projection debt growth 2000 therefore alternative set range offer consideration may wish retain provisional range perhaps implicit indication public low weight place monetary aggregate formulate monetary policy exist range might also select increase productivity growth observe recent year see likely transitory82 hand humphreyhawkin report last july note adjustment monetary range might need rapid recent pace productivity growth persist fact exceptional strength second half 1999 nonfarm business productivity grow estimate 314 percent last four quarter light analysis productivity behavior recent year staff revise upward estimate expansion potential output committee shift use price stability range mid1990s potential output growth think around 214 percent however staff estimate potential GDP growth average 312 percent last four year add perhaps 12 percentage point upward bias implicit deflator would imply nominal GDP growth 4 percent rate condition price stability range alternative II adjust upward well align fast steadystate growth nominal GDP assume historically typical velocity behavior show chart 2 m2 velocity stable history M3 velocity generally trend central tendency potential output growth imply forecast year appear 312 334 percent expansion real GDP give roughly unchanged unemployment rate growth rate potential plus estimate inflation measurement bias would close midpoint range show alternative II know staff revise projection potential output growth 4 percent year next though high imply potential growth estimate outside forecaster productivity surprise generally side late uncertainty reflect idea price stability range rather point estimate nevertheless select adjust range give alternative II humphreyhawkin report testimony could clarify revision reflect fast expansion potential GDP observe recent year rather projection potential growth go forward could also state additional information suggest different pace potential GDP committee could alter benchmark range addition report could affirm adjustment range reflect change longrun goal stable price signify great weight would place monetary aggregate formulation policy chairman GREENSPAN question bill MR jordan I trouble ideai know say last year repeat herethat fast productivity growth mean raise money growth range I83 suppose 19th century discover fast productivity growth would say go dig gold fast rate nothing inherent objective price stability try purchase power money say favorable supply shock raise money growth objective there be reason cut money growth target adverse supply shock would n’t I be sure back 1970s 1980s do n’t argue lower target want view transitory effect acceleration productivity growth lower report rate inflation transitory decline price level increase purchase power money would onetime decline price leveli do n’t want use " d " word supply shock go away would return toward sort balance equilibrium would also I do n’t see follow leave money growth range alone communicate important reduce weight give need change say pay attention change mean do n’t pay attention MR WHITESELL perhaps I respond I think absolutely right case temporary supply shock would expect concept longrun steady state condition alter transitory supply shock temporary increase productivity fact believe productivity growth surge experience last four year transitory go go away soon would reason alter longrun price stability however believe permanent component increase productivity I think people presumably would alter expect steady state growth nominal GDP believe need84 comparable growth rate say m2 expect steady state growth nominal GDP accommodate kind steady state expansion presumably would want adjust longrun range aggregate MR jordan part I question linkage say adjust nominal growth GDP ; it be sort nominal spend effect point I get yesterday regard dave stockton ’s simulation clear ought explicit rather implicitly say want monetary policy go " accommodative " nominal demand increase real supplyside favorable development go let we also think implication symmetric matter surprising adverse supply shock would would say " let we cut money growth target " probably MR KOHN permanent nature certainly productivity growth shift 1973 order achieve federal reserve ’s goal stable price maximum employment fomc timethough goal set forth federal reserve act timeshould shift target m2 growth rate question steady state nominal GDP growth steady change rate growth productivity expect persist rather onetime change consistent bill say MR PRELL sense logic apply logic get current target it be recalibrate target new longerterm trend MR jordan I would agree don say case ability distinguish adverse oil shock 19731974 something much later profession come view secular trend call productivity I do n’t know that85 ability know experience give time allow we make judgment committee certainly 1970s MR KOHN late right I think certain extent observe go see thing like oil shock dollar appreciation depreciation excise taxis whatever might change price level see ongoing change productivity I agree take time recognize committee struggle last several year four year since appear retrospect productivity growth change I think true change range would say good guess bill say permanent component change productivity reevaluate annual basis chairman GREENSPAN be n’t issue little limit effect good I judge assume longterm m2 velocity flat effectively engage estimate longterm nominal GDP issue ifand I underline word " if”price stability goal define fall specific range central tendency m2 strike question whether bad price decline word hold context rise productivity rise real growththat keep nominal samewe get decline longterm price different issue I think that be legitimate question ask come strictly question goal long run stipulate assume stable velocity issue implicit m2 projection I do n’t think complex I do n’t disagree word say I do n’t disagree word opponent say debate either I raise question : really problem here86 MR MEYER I think issue this : goal stable money growth stable inflation goal stable money growth you ’ll take whatever inflation come depend upon productivity shock chairman GREENSPAN may okay MR MEYER may okay goal I understand operate mandate achieve price stability I think indicate necessarily zero inflation least stable inflation rate make choice MR WHITESELL chairman mention give midpoint exist range 3 percent take estimate potential output plus measurement bias imply nominal GDP 4 percent consistent price stabilitythat mean aim deflation 1 percent per year MR jordan I agree that be arithmetic implication start period price stability start price stability later find acceleration productivity growth would one thing acceleration productivity growth we have start positive rate inflation somehow measure mean deceleration inherit rate something move toward price stability juncture today concern like register yesterday staff other I would afraid message change range would convey rather communicate go put emphasis achieve high rate growth would seem say willing accommodative acceleration inflation could say accommodate fast productivity growth I might even persuade that87 right thing I think message would hear accommodate fast inflation chairman GREENSPAN suppose say explicitly issue say try find range price stability envisage potential growth rise therefore thing equal range go objective remain several year ago MR jordan I sure credibility say believe ; I I know people would n’t believe I say chairman GREENSPAN I do n’t believe seriousness I thinkand I may wrong thisthat extent raise question capacity minute humphreyhawkin report speech make say essentially nothing changedthat fundamentally goal price stability potential rise necessity unless change income velocity money supply goal different say it be arithmetical truism MR MEYER I think easy attribute adjustment range productivity nobody actually believe goal set range pure price stability nobody believe goal price stability view people think accommodate high inflation raise range chairman GREENSPAN president parry MR PARRY question relate much discussion go alternative II I think say midpoint 4 percent m2 consistent shift productivity also goal price stability potential output growth would 4 percent area price stability would define zero inflation I guess is88 troubling nominal GDP 4 percent mean goal zero GDP deflator go around table nobody would give number MR WHITESELL I be sure answer question suggest 312 percent potential growth observe MR PARRY oh I see MR WHITESELL plus ½ percent measurement bias word measure GDP deflator would ½ percent true inflation would zero MR PARRY well group happy I be really happy MR KOHN that be way range construct last five year reason arithmetic mind committee might want think whether want change consistent committee MR PARRY okay chairman GREENSPAN president poole MR POOLE I think explicit number involve would good thing we suppose say longterm goal 1 percent deflator estimate 4 percent real growth potential add 5 percent would right I fear however without explicit inflation goal people read 5 percentgiven price creep bit pressure sidea indicate go accommodate somewhat high inflation message would give would fear explicit89 chairman GREENSPAN clearly side question people read accommodate inflation argument move I think unambiguous point may case problem MR POOLE well I say willing explicit longrun inflation target estimate potential growth I think make argument I believe I have say I think much explicit inflation target view would constructive chairman GREENSPAN essentially say price stability goal want numerical judgment price stability issue MR POOLE yes give I ’ll call " reveal preference " way actually behave I think market believe perfectly satisfied inflation rate somewhere neighborhood right that be little I would regard zero inflation properly measure take account bias index good guess something like 112 percent CPI 1 percent deflator take account measurement bias pretty good estimate zero inflation really somewhat right I think market believe quite happy somewhat evidence reveal preference term decision make chairman GREENSPAN governor gramlich MR gramlich I buy change range I reluctance give discussion suppose raise range m2 M3 point tell would say debt would reason change debt range reduce federal debt what90 MR WHITESELL never interpret debt range longrun price stability range could move interpretation debt well think desirable make interpretation three range consistent make longrun price stability range want could debt range match m2 long period time debt grown rate comparable nominal GDP growth take decline debt velocity 1980s seriously think experience could repeat future might leave debt range right 3 7 percent interpret price stability range speak humphreyhawkin report past chairman GREENSPAN president broaddus MR BROADDUS I think say well mr chairman one make pretty solid argument make change I do n’t feel strongly I believe go significant communication issue bill poole jerry jordan other point whole discussion good argument numerical inflation target clear nominal anchor long run I think key thing background I would prefer stay thing bother little I certainly sense increase trend productivity growth I uncertain transitory exactly magnitude I do n’t think argument absolutely ironclad go route try explain way go involve take position thing I quite ready take position yet I do n’t see particular reason chairman GREENSPAN president guynn91 MR GUYNN I would like join bill poole al broaddus comment hear I see considerable merit move direction explicit inflation target I do n’t know whether go talk morning particularly absence target I believe much smart leave range alone moment I think could distract much important policy work I do n’t think ought confuse message send public moment chairman GREENSPAN president hoenig MR HOENIG mr chairman change range always dicey issue day matter say interpretation reality time I could talk I think build consensus rise trend productivity improvement real fact willing accept thatand may notthen move target make sense term consistency price stability I agree jerry jordan say might react productivity shock early period I think thing little different balance I could come favor raise range chairman GREENSPAN president minehan MS minehan thank mr chairman I want go back question portion discussion page 20 bluebook don talk 214 percent trend productivity growth oppose something high MR KOHN trend potential output growth committee first set targets92 MS minehan oh yes excuse 212 percent trend productivity growth MR WHITESELL currently it be 3 percent MS minehan much upward revision result change nipa number MR WHITESELL much actually part staff ’s current estimate potential output growth mid1990sthrough second quarter 1995is still 214 percent current estimate last four year contrast 312 percent ; 4 percent go forward ratchet potential output growth estimate structural productivity second quarter 1995 move 214 314 percent begin 1998 potential output 334 percent begin year we have predict 4 percent MS minehan mid1990s potential output growth somewhere around 214 212 percent full percentage point high MR WHITESELL estimate still second quarter 1995 potential output growth 214 percent start year 134 percentage point high 4 percent MS minehan yes MR PRELL case we have do little extrapolate recent experience nearterm period think might want adjust range one question would assumption potential GDP growth would want rest assumption experience past yearswhere behavior unemployment rate relative GDP example would seem consistent potential output93 growth somewhere 312 percent range little high would want look forward optimistic way assumption 4 percent MS minehan I understand exactly want I try get handle effect nipa revision I know effecta tenth percentage pointfrom nipa revision MR PRELL a tenth come change MS minehan I be think communication issue MR PRELL sure MS minehan portion productivity change really fallout revise number well way presumably result nipa change something would help communicate reason change MR POOLE cathy I could comment quickly that : do n’t change nominal nipa revision do change split real output price respect revision really bear issue MS minehan change productivity MR POOLE that be right offset change inflation number essentially change split nominal MS minehan I realize be n’t point MR PRELL forwardlooke relevant think bias adjustment price measure go switch one component nominal GDP would wash MR WHITESELL back mid1990s think perhaps bias close percentage point whereas it be ½ percentage point94 MS minehan it be ½ percentage point I think term look forward range suppose different productivity number part think different pastbecause change break price bias underlie real growththen give we nonpolicy orient reason make change think growth rate money say I think people comment communication difficulty point particularly environment think outlook inflation bias side evenly bias ; upward bias whatever want say risk everyone around table yesterday talk underlie pressure economy I do n’t think anybody satisfied exist state inflation number look okay direction likely move difficulty communicate reason change range tend say something willingness accommodate condition exist right nowunless people say want get lot precise MR WHITESELL term communication issue president minehan inform public last july change range might come adjustment assessment productivity MS minehan I know chairman GREENSPAN governor ferguson MR ferguson thank mr chairman I walk really quite agnostic issue I know matter people feel strongly I interested hear side I come conclusion perhaps well course leave well enough alonenot make change stagefor variety reason jack95 guynn raise one reason important course year I suspect fair amount scrutiny core policy matter I would prefer go period explain monetary aggregate issue frankly terribly important we right secondly whole issue also come numerical inflation target I happen one think qualitative inflation target serve we well I see reason open debate I think would course reach decision change range third thing worry I listen conversation also force we sense explicit committee view productivity productivity trend I be sure I hear consistency among committee member issue finally I believe lesson learn central bank colleague around world position talk defend action visàvis happen growth monetary aggregate particular ECB put weight money growth perhaps lambaste week week newspaper allow M3 growth target I think much well position clearly say put much weight aggregate M3 growth may may target I frankly prefer quite clear communication enough issue need clear leave one alone course year I think much well shape give thing likely chairman GREENSPAN vice chair96 vice chairman MCDONOUGH I associate governor ferguson ’s wise remark chairman GREENSPAN governor meyer MR MEYER well different perspective I suppose I must say interesting discussion far I think identify two issue relevant target range first whether revise reflect fast rate growth trend GDP second implicit inflation target use set midpoint revise range alternative II deal first issue I believe perpetuate possible misunderstand inflation target pure price stability adjust estimate inflation bias I say possible misunderstand committee fully discuss prefer inflation rate certainly have n’t work achieve consensus point strict price stability target implicit target range today might ask question : really make we look like central bank focus price stability around world like central bank least transparent inflation objective I think latter I offer alternative iii set range incorporate view implicit inflation target set midpoint m2 growth rate reflect I have call price stability plus cushion although remain lot uncertainty precise value trend GDP growth might evolve next several year I think current monetary growth range outdate badly need revision I comfortable judgment reflect alternative II range update reflect assumption trend GDP growth currently 312 percent humphreyhawkin report testimony97 emphasize fomc reconsider set monetary aggregate range incoming information lead we revise estimate trend real GDP growth instead think monetary growth range carve stone use digitalsubject costless adjustment response flow new information let turn second issue undoubtedly controversial one I think send implicit message define price stability set range try escape reality I doubt successful change range many people already indicate may result probe implicit inflation target clearly go exercise explicitly set range question present public : blur logic ignore issue entirely transparent I think mainand maybe onlypurpose monetary aggregate range today mean offer implicit inflation target perhaps view today ’s discussion range opportunity internal discussion set inflation target consistent interpretation price stability might also look discussion decision today opportunity another step direction transparency I want point view subtle real difference " explicit inflation target " " inflation target " I understand central bank conduct monetary policy achieve price stability without establish inflation target consistent interpretation price stability give want market help we achieve target also value explicit I believe I accept explicit inflation target without sign specific strategy achieve I interpret " inflation target " be98 country price stability mandate explicit numerical target uniformly set range center I have refer price stability plus cushion view appropriate option light concern deterioration cyclical performance near zero inflation zero nominal interest rate valve therefore I offer alternative iii range center prefer midpoint 5 percent reflect sum 312 percent rate trend growth GDP ½ percentage point estimate bias chain measure price index GDP 1 percentage point cushion suggest 3 percent 7 percent range would small step take toward explicit inflation target enhance transparency would big step committee take I give alternative strategy would set central range rather point bottom point consistent pure price stability upper point consistent price stability plus cushion case central tendency might 4 5 percent attach symmetric range central tendency would yield range 2 7 percent m2 analogous australian approach set " thick " point target 2 3 percent problem particularly indecision m2 growth inside central range would allow we defer precise set midpoint consensus could reach committee perhaps consultation congress chairman GREENSPAN president moskow MR MOSKOW thank mr chairman interesting discussion practical standpoint I come back exactly place I last 11 time I discuss make change range I think would mislead public we make change unless a99 huge education program front other say change would give impression place lot weight range formulation monetary policy be n’t I think communication challenge significantnot insurmountable significantbecause lot people do n’t accept premise economy ’s potential growth rate high many people around table think day we have explain well ; otherwise people go think move range indicate go conduct monetary policy way would view inflationary finally inflation target issue question really whether quantitative inflation target important issue I think one discuss view discuss separately context monetary policy range something reasonable people obviously disagree disagreement around table I believe important discuss I really think call separate discussion entirely chairman GREENSPAN president stern MR STERN thank mr chairman well I do n’t lot add many people already observe discuss case unlike previous discussion I think today arithmetically substantively case raise range pretty strong I do n’t feel strongly I think communication challenge say guess communication challenge deal I think market participant would get message pretty directly use vehicle available we guess judgment I could wrong I do n’t feel strongly raise range chairman GREENSPAN president boehne100 MR BOEHNE governor ferguson capture view nearly completely I would like associate comment chairman GREENSPAN governor kelley MR KELLEY thank mr chairman listen discussion I say I reverse position I come morning question be : permanent high rate growth perceive permanent I think ought move alternative II I note concept sustainable growth shift meaningfully past several year seem could well shift possibly either direction I note good reason able recognize formally accept shift sustainable considerable lag dynamic involve sustainable growth move around able perceive confidence lag I think run considerable risk sync lot time go chase explicitly move range around I think hard explain easily misunderstood misinterpret public I see compelling reason chairman GREENSPAN governor gramlich MR gramlich thank mr chairman comment go sound bit tired I apologize I think transparency good I have say number time I think would well advise move general direction inflation target point might even try agree explicit target I think right big fight fight I have soon pass particular one talk explicit target connection monetary range I would prefer change alternative I chairman GREENSPAN president jordan101 MR jordan thank early comment period I question mode I ’ll state view talk two different thing back forth time hereabout belief sustain growth productivity potential output would appropriate stance monetary policy especially imply monetary growth versus acceleration productivity least separate analytically way think matter consensus go real growth order 4 percentthrough combination productivity gain labor force growthand raise range could communicate committee progrowth one thing I would hard time object question though acceleration deceleration fair degree uncertainty happen productivity run high risk miscommunicate policy intention I would delight I think everybody would productivity growth accelerate point real output growth 6 percent I still would necessarily conclude quickly change monetary growth assumption that be favorable productivity surprise nothing wrong increase purchase power money nothing wrong manifest distribute wealth gain society idea dollar buy know sector industry productivity growth increase rapidly price fall good thing reason think price good service need rise fast otherwise would order hit statistical measure average price change I do n’t think rule idea favorable productivity development accept associate rise purchase power money fall price level102 chairman GREENSPAN president mcteer MR MCTEER I wish jerry have n’t say chairman GREENSPAN erase record start laughter MR MCTEER make misgiving regard I say I agree gary stern ’s ambivalence ; I do n’t feel strongly issue one way since I record believe productivity gain transitory phenomenon consistency suggest I guess I would small preference raise range although I could accept deflation way take productivity gain well chairman GREENSPAN president parry MR PARRY mr chairman I like governor meyer say although I must admit I have probably happy thin cushion would lead think case make alternative II I keep come back idea really much confidence forecast aggregate mean therefore probably good draw attention balance I slight preference alternative I either instance however I think make clear target aggregate goal price stability define way talk early chairman GREENSPAN I come room staunchly anything range previously least think possibility change unlike lot around table I think productivity change unquestionably real anything still accelerate argument cite difficulty communicate logic change really quite persuasive since successful defuse interest range question be : gain stir this103 issue answer much except academic consistency dismiss materially do n’t strike high priority among set goal general let weigh little price stability question I think jerry jordan raise issue go become important be n’t long ago considerable discussion optimum price path talk issue example price stability necessary condition economic stability fundamentally reason opt price stabilityon ground risk premium rise side price stability price stability lower bound evidence risk uncertainty almost definition yet hard argue case say highly technologically orient economy productivity rise rapidly nominal sale profit margin reasonably stable price however define fall remember price easy define certain instance visualize sale profit income since hour unambiguous unit I guess measure average hourly compensation price unambiguous notion therefore price stability move high tech economy issue become lot tricky I think realize question be n’t price stability ultimate goal ; ca n’t secondary issue subject difference measurement careful term goal lock I think point go interesting discussion issue moment I must say I persuade great idea move forward somebody else well try explain be n’t go easy I think raise serious question I judge discussion around table clearly desire large majority people104 keep range m2 M3 debt I presume alternative I let we vote total alternative accordingly would read appropriate language MR BERNARD I read page 28 bluebook bottom half page : " the federal open market committee seek monetary financial condition foster price stability promote sustainable

total 114 percentage point tighten end year little thereafter I already note staff forecast path policy consistent stabilize unemployment rate inflation rate still current configuration market rate may acceptable committee least extent inflation risk become clear committee might uncertain enough judgment NAIRU substantially project level unemployment rate want weight importance plan at107 time even fourthquarter nipa price datum longerterm trend inflation cost would yet seem confirm hypothesis economy operate well beyond potential fourquarter average core inflation rate remain relatively stable effect strengthen compensation unit cost offset fast productivity even committee convince need tighten 25 basis point eventually long see restraint build yield curve clearly inadequate cost gradual approach contemplate policy action would seem small gradualism would seem advantage give opportunity adjust trajectory action time base new information economy financial market flexibility might see especially valuable much uncertainty prospective aggregate supply financial market volatile reaction policy difficult predict past committee deviate approach primarily expectation psychology move adversely work committee ’s objective current circumstance longterm inflation expectation seem remain reasonably well anchor moderate inflation rate nominalreal yield spread treasury example still embodie 10year average CPI inflation 212 percent lesswithin range since last june although lot year ago governor gramlich notedwith percentage point tighten yield curve firm dollar foreign exchange market demand dollar asset seem match burgeon supply current account deficit suggest absence concern among global investor adequate policy response develop inflation problem however committee see inflation risk great financial marketsperhap committee put weight possibility sustainable unemployment rate well current rateand believe need tighten considerably fast build yield curve might want raise target federal fund rate 50 basis point meet committee would surprising market action would likely prompt increase interest exchange rate drop equity price reaction would unwanted integral aspect less accommodative financial condition see necessary restrain real growth contain inflation public ’s interpretation market reaction would depend importantly associate balance risk statement a statement risk balance would suggest committee see financial108 condition firm equally likely produce rise stable fall inflation announcement would tend limit increase rate ; indeed one could rule rally capital marketsespecially equity marketsif symmetry see expression fomc substantially less concern longerterm inflation pressure market perceive likely give strength demand firmness labor market committee would still view risk unbalanced toward high inflation even 50 basis point tighten response interest rate asset price combination could considerable market would remain alert attempt discern whether additional tighten might forthcoming next meet response volatility might mute extent committee also try indicate statement necessarily contemplate another firm next meetingthat emphasize time next action highly dependent incoming datum committee ’s new disclosure policy contemplate announcement might provide indication official language focus longerrun economic environment instead possibility nearterm policy action chairman GREENSPAN question don chairman GREENSPAN president parry MR PARRY don I have like hear thought greenbook characterize current stance monetary policy one part greenbook reference real equilibrium fund rate 5 percent I suppose calculation involve PCE chainweighte core rate less food energy tobacco recent experience would suggest inflation premium maybe 112 percent one ’s analysis backward look 2 percent forwardlooke would suggest bluebook say nominal fund rate reach level 612 7 percent policy stimulative mode bluebook say MR KOHN bluebook extension greenbook forecast chart 3 immediately page 8 essentially say say stable inflation casethe109 middle line dot dashesthat fund rate get 712 percent next two year period inflation rate rise it be 2 percentage point real tighten 112 percentage point real tighten I think message greenbook reflect alternative strategy policy clearly position keep inflation rise fact position keep inflation pressure intensify sense unchanged fund rate unemployment rate would likely fall MR PARRY increase ¼ ½ even ¾ percentage point would still position basically stimulate economy provide environment inflationary pressure likely continue rise MR KOHN I try say briefing depend importantly weight put NAIRU calculation meet important obviously market perceive go may even important term effect economic activity it be intermediate longerterm interest rate effect I think important trajectory market perceive go reflect intermediate longerterm interest rate see though effect economic activity effect dollar presumably equity price discount rate matter equity price day point market build approximately 125 basis point tighten next year greenbook build MR PARRY move cautiously would important communicate clearly work apparently still done110 MR KOHN that be right I think balance risk sentence design judgment combination 25 basis point increase unbalanced risk sentence plus potentially discount rate change would tend communicate one never certain market go react MR PARRY communication probably would modify much go 50 basis point MR KOHN go 50 basis point unbalanced risk sentence I think would communicate great sense concern committee ’s part market perceive MR PARRY great sense concern analytical work present we MR KOHN I agree I think would tend communicate put weight estimate economy operate well beyond potential unemployment rate need rise appreciably stem inflation question whether want wait evidence fact case sense it be strategy issuewhether want surprise market assessment wait get evidence MR PARRY thank chairman GREENSPAN don comfortable feel simulation econometric structure simulate provide good record judge outcome respect inflation cost like MR KOHN lot uncertainty supply side economy I would try communicate run number simulation present the111 bluebook underscore point I think staff catch quickly ; might even ahead productivity certainly catch quickly growth productivity modify wageprice assessment effect several people remark yesterday sacrifice ratio high see economy effect little less inflation prone sense even take account supply side effect rate inflation seem less sensitive output gap might I think move quickly datum allow toward good assessment supply side effect right ; assessment embody simulation I try emphasize result particularly extent firm crucially dependent assessment lot uncertainty committee may want think carefully much weight put chairman GREENSPAN simulation statistical discrepancy MR KOHN I do n’t know that be income side thing simulation I believe basically do product side chairman GREENSPAN know huge open statistical discrepancy create different coefficient one would get use product side I would submit stability number outcome get simulation relative forecast discrepancy much large I think realize concern careful number difference small suspicion policy implication significance important recognize example raise question whether productivity improvement real112 eventually I get remark I try provide evidence something unusual go one thing know apparent mark increase profit margin fourth quarter context relatively modest set increase cost structure make difficult get around conclusion productivity growth significantly number give we basically reduce widen negative statistical discrepancy I want say old aficionado build econometric model I know I know can not I little concern definitiveness result ; give appearance reality I submit model do n’t forecast well deficient coefficient simulate forecast use coefficient give one sense reality root false I say useful exercise ; consider term actual number produce structure change tell we one example issue larry meyer raise yesterday respect wicksellian real interest rate qualitatively important issue discuss put specific number say number basis point need move fund rate make system balance ludicrous I would laugh hilariously serious question way model precise range error can not give answer tell direction rough order magnitude presumption small change make difference I think misread technique MR PRELL mr chairman may I make couple comment one I would encourage people look simulation broad sense simply directional sense I think message carry even one adjust coefficient significantly113 question statistical discrepancy many thing would affect would affect potential output aggregate demand side equation chairman GREENSPAN I disagree factually correct MR PRELL matter mismeasurement output growth recent period something would need recalibrateboth term estimate potential well actual growth chairman GREENSPAN change probability sense security one underlie rate trend productivity MR PRELL true chairman GREENSPAN assume right second derivative positive quite period time fall zero assume last 3 4 greenbook MR PRELL actually case assume second derivative positive forecast period relative recent period make assumption past 2001 chairman GREENSPAN remember forecast fall MR PRELL that be longterm assumption simulation yes chairman GREENSPAN I do n’t want get detail discussion it be I want make clear sometimes presumption accuracy result model produce I do n’t think convey humility require I want put table want seminar I would delight get involve I think important issue114 MR PRELL I take backseat one term humility model I want close loop one thing everyone understand do projection get sausage make fact balance income product side forecast actually continue widen statistical discrepancy that be build baseline forecast 2001 model extension effect take board derive structure carry future beyond 2001 base structure judgmental greenbook forecast chairman GREENSPAN point suppose actually go direction look I argue I disagree general policy focus come greenbook I happen think year go move fund rate quite significantly high number I would put back head would terribly different come lot implicit intermediate period I believe terribly careful notion know do n’t know I little concern basically exaggerate extent knowledge readily I do n’t mean digress long discussion president jordan MR jordan thank I lot reservation national income account set information use think increasingly globalize economy certainly would construct start scratch today give way see world go nevertheless it be try torture datum effort find useful information I think useful set exercise simulation standpoint uncertain time kind thing degree uncertainty specific thing vary lot people quite115 certain one thing other uncertain thing exercise least allow people rather explicit certain certain standpoint I think useful occur I look one exercise I would interested include involve augment taylor rule ben mccallum write aboutessentially 1970s would call taylor rule proviso clause would one additional exercise I would curious present I go ask question characterize understand tell close far I characterization first I need digress framework look last three decade least we have essentially two compete paradigm one supply demand money somehow measure relate supply demand output unemployment rate NAIRU time empirical experience tend favor one framework time frameworkgoe back forth reason uncertainty I look different chart listen narrative go message I take material this : great confidence one lead indicatorwhether NAIRU framework money supplymoney demand framework something elsethe gradualist one afford term small incremental change policy action less confidence one lead indicator aggressive one one might see blip new information order take policy action might like characterization label I would put simulation call realizedinflation rule " bunker hill " " white eye " approach soon we116 see blip inflation bang move move aggressively fair message come regard one ’s confidence uncertainty lead indicator MR KOHN I think fair message illustrate chart 4 certain extent I be sure gradualism part certainly relate policy success chart 4 look realizedinflation rule one pricestability rule pricestability scenario chart 3 derive model assume household business federal reserve least pretty good idea go form expectation federal reserve assume good idea go happen future change fund rate sense well alternative case sure go happen future inflationrule use illustrate wait see inflation sure may bad rule follow provide certain kind shock occur economythat favorable supply shock secondly note president jordan see inflationthese four quarter change it be one quarter ’s worth inflationyou need respond fairly robustly twice robustly taylor rule would respond circumstance uncertain supply side economy you be experience favorable supply shock outcome bad certainly well act incorrect information basic message take approximately correct : run successful policy respond ex post certain circumstance careful ; that be case circumstance it be good preemptive know information policy response reactive get aggressive chairman GREENSPAN president broaddus117 MR BROADDUS don I suppose half comment half question premise idea simulation useful I think useful especially make comparison particular simulation I be chart 3 I want compare socalle baseline scenario stableinflation scenario baseline scenario basically incorporate tighten assume greenbook forecast 2000 tighten 2001 begin tighten result show bottom panel page PCE inflation rate 3 percent steady state be n’t long ago talk core CPI I imagine relationship remain term use talk we be talk maybe 312 334 percent inflation core CPI measure I think result would acceptable many peopleif anyaround table stableinflation scenario though produce well result ; whether would acceptable everybody I do n’t know difference 2000 scenario baseline difference 2001 continue tighten I would expect order get much difference would move strongly year order preempt inflation expectation raise question mind whether structure model take adequate account credibility issue effect I think might want comment MR KOHN structure basically assume credibility unless federal reserve change structure assume 2 percent target public know 2 percent target long follow policy action flow targetso confirm period period public ’s perception targetthen expectation firmly anchor happen partly follows118 response president stern yesterday sacrifice ratio fed deviate action public expect say 2 percent target public begin change expectation give different sacrifice ratio short run give different effect short run public would slowly learn 3 percent target instead 2 percent target 2001 I think part difference nominal rate be n’t different that be case real rate tighten 2001 get bit ahead rise inflation real rate considerably high 2001 large extent build extra restraint MR BROADDUS that be good point especially end year MR KOHN right there be almost percentage point extra restraint end 2001 persist next year significant amount extra restraint chairman GREENSPAN governor gramlich MR gramlich I say yesterday I like exercise time I think humble actually add dimension humility go productivity debate I always think whatever rate productivity positive shockthat productivity go upthat would good news inflation would make economy generally less inflationary larry meyer make point yesterday I think right you have say past mr chairman link supply demand necessarily could get situation illustration larry give yesterday indicate productivity shock would actually inflationary I suppose could neutral put humility table I think also ought humble even change productivity do n’t necessarily know go price forecast119 MR KOHN see chart 6 positive productivity shock tend lower inflation rate short run unless target inflation rate hard I think one need differentiate shortrun effect longerrun effect let we say short run productivity shock consistent dave stockton ’s chart yesterday inflation would tend go profit margin swell competition would drive price time however demand feed back lower unemployment rate wage begin catch high productivity end high equilibrium interest rate approximately equal size productivity shock depend model obviously shortrun effect let run long find situation MR gramlich true also forwardlooke longterm market stock market could demand effect get telescope front high consumption investment demand MR KOHN mechanism model whether it be sufficiently capture model question effect extra earning stock price feed back consumptionthough may think capture last couple yearsis model chairman GREENSPAN president parry MR PARRY don I two comment one you be uncertain whether growth outcome supply shift demand shift would n’t nominal income rule dominate taylor rule inflation rule term exercise like MR KOHN price shocka change price level old oil shock variety use studythen nominal income rule way take part in120 inflation part output regard it be much taylor rule might different dynamic path I do n’t think would differ much way it be bit like discussion folk little ago nominal income rule tilt productivity growth keep old nominal income you have start build deflation economy start point price stability I think kind supply shock occur matter lot MR PARRY comment follow chairman say early seem important keep mind standard error exercise significant I must admit I do n’t think case I would terrify outcome instead I be scare chairman GREENSPAN question let get start I believe enter period considerable turbulence financial market characteristic one would expect though may never experience upward slope general acceleration technological application accelerate output per hour old " S " curve scenario look theoretically never observe past current economy scurve characteristic I look macro datum see company ; see multiple application lot new technology something different happen way economy function differ economy I observe past I look economy every day professionally since summer 1948 nothing like experience dramatically different121 leave aside measure productivity ask reconcile behavior profit margin domestic business operation recent year price pattern see algebraically get income side acceleration profit margin productivity I see evidence moment acceleration productivity stop second derivative late datum still positive I aware evidence expansion slow general notion significant deceleration first quarter interesting forecast onethird quarter point I do n't know evidence support slow growth forecast certainly initial claim significantly order quite strong retail market quite strong indeed get slow GDP growth measure either income side product side one would presume would evidence slow growth productivity alternatively evidence change I think reasonable view productivity probably still accelerate indeed examine earning estimate security analyst include look earning outlook companybycompany overall estimate january still rise sense forecast longterm earning per share still go rapidly evidence suggest productivityenhance investment still move since observe unusual I indicate last meet tend get statistical acrophobia accustom see motor vehicle sale level housing start high interest rate business activity robust virtually every part economy inflation move iota indeed total unit cost four quarter end low see cycle unit labor cost barely moved122 rise inflation fourth quarter show wholly profit margin actual unit cost grant rough nature datum apparently decline fourth quarter inflationary price environment inflationary cost environment look inflation expectation good measure view one derive subtract yield inflationprotecte 10year treasury security socalle synthetic 10year nominal rate get good estimate expect 10year CPI inflation number barely different today december 1997 implicit inflation expectation calculation decline asian crisis recover spring last year absolutely flat since sure actual nominal 10year rate go compare real 10 year rate merely reflection fact adjustment " ontherun " " off therun " rate appropriately make raise nominal rate 12 percentage point since november last year word dramatic change socalle synthetic rate nominal rate give false view accelerate inflation expectation unless properly adjust do staff degree illiquidity inflationindexed treasury security visàvis appropriate nominal treasury obligation seem acceleration process would create problem wealth effect problem discuss past potential supply increase pari passu rise trend productivity I believe still accelerate pronounce effect demand obviously rise productivity create high real income expenditure make leave aside issue whether stock market appropriately price rise productivity also create rational upward adjustment longterm earning expectation else equal result increase value stock market asset unless wealth effect123 argue case though frankly I think evidence overwhelming direction increase purchase power increase supply case recent year result excess demand basically meet increase net trade deficit draw new source labor latter find drain pool currently unemploye increase participation rate immigration increase net import draw new worker obviously safety valve time fill gap create excess demand ; can not draw upon indefinitely reason discuss previously high rate return drive technological boom also attract dollar abroador I say increase claim united statesand hold dollar essentially unchanged process go question long obviously I note minimum unemployment rate zero I care whether bring notion NAIRU analysis point ultimate limit unemployment call zero sit imbalance essentially say wealth effect nature can not persist indefinitely argue imply gap excess demand supply always fill without create major inflationary pressure point I make rest econometric model merely proposition wealth effect consumption accelerate productivity continue increase expect earning question basically be : close gap close gap obviously real longterm interest rate go quite significantly put pressure financial market end day go swamp rate discount stock124 market virtually zero good I judge slight exaggeration slight problem monetary policy work effect overall financial market presumption 25 basis point 50 basis point even 75 basis point change overnight rate come grip supplydemand imbalance view silliness extreme overnight rate tie process direct way actually foster term structure interest rate policy action thereby influence real longterm rate I say algebraically equivalent larry meyer say yesterday wicksellian real rate gap difference I think simply may view gap expect equilibrium real rate market rate look process disaggregate perspective order disaggregate really look real world wicksellian world crucial issue wealth effect policy question confront we view influence real longterm rate primary force involve process work would like think power really do n't kind power except extent influence market perform strike stage unusual situation anything go become still difficult we regard I think answer don kohn give correct onenamely inflation stay short run acceleration productivity ultimately solve problem gap mean acceleration productivity lead continue expectation accelerate earning per share way eliminate wealth effect eliminate the125 discount ratethe market interest rate use investor calculate present value expect earningsto rise I think process occur case interesting issue really get question longerterm effect inflation model bond market show real evidence accelerate inflation expectation short market basically say right wrong longterm rate go rise eventually close gap may also argue current rate right rate I personally believe one assume prevail opinion market question confront we context phenomenon rate use investor discount future earning rise necessary condition stability question facilitate rise put monetary policy issue somewhat reverse order don kohn I think crucial point express continue express general view goal basically move fund rate consistently point I do n’t know whether eventually need increase 50 basis point 75 basis point 100 basis point 125 basis point guess increase likely toward upper end range view key consideration stage make certain adopt use call " symmetry " would wrong thing matter else indeed I go argue 50 basis point increase I would say decide 50 basis point would asymmetry opinion 50 basis point symmetry would terrible mistake stage would imply job convey market consistent clearly acceleration126 productivity I think increase turbulence financial market scene embark routine incremental tighten argument 50 basis point today I would say argument basically twofold one general rule environment like last tighten move make go mistake know time almost invariably mistake tighten small incremental dose size mistake small definition secondly far importantly I think late evaluation equity premium stock market downright scary I have n’t see anything like fact use inflate earning expectation security analyst PE ratio get extremely impressive equity premium back 1987 recall longterm rate go stock market go market run steam far worse situation I concern aggressive process tighten could crack market end severe problem instability I do n't know far go indeed I do n't know long continue tighten 25 basis point sort work hypothesis I would argue think term move every meet move 25 basis point increment would continue course unless appear get behind curve inflation inflation expectation case would raise size adjustment hand could continue implement strategy begin see wealth effect stabilize andor gap supply demand begin close unless happen remain unusual period never experience I argue something come particular simulation need argument127 valid good I judge wealth effect market extremely high valuation level take action close supplydemand gap I would propose therefore move fund rate 25 basis point today include press release equivalent use call asymmetry would full expectation move march turn economic expansion accelerate indeed I every reason suspect may would policy issue view ought look look underlie inflation pressure economy become large I think move fast today I think appropriate move 25 basis point issue asymmetric statementi do n't remember exact language plan use express vice chairman MCDONOUGH " balance risk " chairman GREENSPAN balance risk toward inflation vice chair vice chairman MCDONOUGH mr chairman I fully support recommendation let make comment issue clearly whether nothing whether firm 25 basis point 50 basis point I agree either case would use balance risk language indicate concern inflation I think look reality perceive everywhere around world good central bank business highly regard highly respect commitment price stability certainly define speech testimony I think unquestione anywhere style strong silent leader one move incrementally move 25 basis point time systematic way move 50 basis pointsto continue analogy sudden strong silent leader start beat chest show tough guy iswhat would your128 conclusion I believe would scare frighten certainly go business normal way continue exhibit confidence earn performance I think thing contribute stabilize economy I agree fully work hypothesis series tighten move appropriate I believe background think I feel strongly 25 basis point combine balance risk statement toward inflation concern far right package today thank chairman GREENSPAN president poole MR POOLE mr chairman I certainly also support recommendation face powerful real force want allow run extent term increase productivity employment real income without upset inflationary apple cart I would like relate comment morning discussion yesterday trade deficit trade deficit also part real adjustment go economy fundamentally nominal phenomenon trade deficit finance capital flow come country rate return high can not object policy determine real force unusual certainly context postwar US history perhaps much back I think move 25 basis point statement balance risk toward inflation exactly right way go market friend market anticipate move see interest rate rise federal fund future prediction market four week anything leave market wonder go 50 basis point balance risk129 statement market would likely say conclude do certainly conclusion want make market much work possible lead way help we figure correct response incoming flow information I absolutely agree likely mean sequence 25 basis point increase meet would n’t correct say dave stockton 's famous language " as far eye see " nevertheless quite time work cooperatively market I think good chance come without big upset I support recommendation 100 percent chairman GREENSPAN president parry MR PARRY mr chairman I would prefer 50 basis point increase fund rate also public statement focus heighten inflation risk future concern time period meet next meet march 21st quite long I might suggest something would make comfortable 25 basis point increase agree assess situation end month considerably datum certainly datum price could review datum see feel time move appropriate I do n't see constrain fix calendar case involve quite long interval meeting 14 year I fed find telephone meeting time like useful perspective though it be certainly one share everyone would reduce possibility get behind curve chairman GREENSPAN option telephone conference always table always it be need employ obviously there130 MR PARRY well I think might case time chairman GREENSPAN market tell we president stern MR STERN thank mr chairman I support recommendation entirety seem give kind technology productivity shock real interest rate need rise extent occur judgment need go I see way accomplish raise fund rate ¼ point increase certainly acceptable I would go beyond aggressive principally consideration uncertainty seem uncertain future path productivity uncertain NAIRU I personally uncertain whether latter useful concept uncertain implication increase real rate already occur effect may turn I think suggest ought chairman GREENSPAN president hoenig MR HOENIG mr chairman I support proposal completely I believe increase risk inflation I think ought say also I much favor 25 basis point several reason first model show direction I agree do n’t show precision I think proceed gradually secondly environment core inflation modest need recognize begin pave way high rate thirdly imbalance remain try take account do n’t want shock system either I think continue steady path appropriate approach therefore I support recommendation chairman GREENSPAN governor meyer131 MR MEYER thank mr chairman I support recommendation 25 basis point increase fund rate I continue call asymmetric posture I also agree likely implement series tightening year ; likely appropriate make move meet period time give uncertainty trend growth NAIRU inflation dynamic also give uncertainty impact policy financial condition broadly I think strong case gradualist approach I hope able use bias announcement accompanie today ’s action skillfully I mean I hope do n't undermine I view sensible expectation rise fund rate build term structure future market lot discussion today uncertainty structure economy inflation dynamic value humility I do n’t want lead discussion oppose humility laughter however I think sometimes draw implication humility suggest inaction though certainly argue mr chairman I want bring we back discussion monetary growth target seem monetary growth target regime danger inaction much less fund rate regime I think consistent point president jordan make productivity growth little high end little lower inflation ; somewhat limit wo n't much problem interest rate regime inaction dangerousand particularly dangerous expansion drive high productivity raise real equilibrium interest rate I also want comment bit discussion role wealth effect clearly important go productivity upturn wealth effect on132 consumption excess demand growth relative supply growth we have lot discussion number arena decline equity premium high equilibrium growth rate raise value equity price a lot partial equilibrium analysis plug formula low equity premium voilàhigher equity price make little sense general equilibrium model model wealth effect ultimately generate increase real interest rate significantly cap diminish increase equity premium I think danger face recently monetary policy somewhat slow tighten allow economy operate partial equilibrium world I think go see equity price evolve general equilibrium world I think one reason bit cautious gradualist I want make comment I perceive consensus strategy unfold seem talk preemptive slow economy trend growth reactive get trend growth stabilize unemployment rate point prepare reactive respond evidence high inflation I struggle issue whether appropriate strategy perhaps even optimal strategy give uncertainty output gap sensible strategy I think gap detail fill obviously decide appropriate path fund rate slow economy trend also keep mind unsuccessful slow economy trend therefore output gap rise even affect policy tighten otherwise would tighten enough slow economy trend push output gap back I133 think consistent nonlinear rule I discuss past uncertain output gap uncertainty whether beyond economy ’s potential diminish greatly output gap increase base good estimate potential third issue I think go focus strategy aggressively move high inflation extent weight response increase output gap inflation rise aggressive would otherwise way think get trend growth unemployment rate stabilize assume policy set strategy consistent stable inflation output gap basically zero inflation begin rise respond increase inflation way ordinarily would also revise estimate output gap require aggressive response inflation would otherwise case thought least shape view strategy go forward chairman GREENSPAN governor ferguson MR ferguson thank mr chairman I agree half recommendation I think reinforce market right I think right expectation secondly I like other move uncertainty talk I also recognize inflation appear stage verge virulent outbreak move 25 basis point seem moderate appropriate I think you be absolutely right suggest time continue look reaction market generally include asset market I think I say yesterday134 likely underlie turbulence finally outlook sentence I believe statement suggest risk balance toward inflation obviously right one use take back thing we be chairman GREENSPAN president boehne MR BOEHNE I agree recommendation ¼ point I think need convey view tighten ahead we good guess significant amount tighten come year may well time series tighten move move ½ point go appropriate today I think ¼ right basic product one confidenceconfidence we be go appropriate keep economy right path today 's environment 25 basis point increase fund rate capture indicate yes know tighten appropriate we be go need do neither go underreact overreact I think important image strong confident central bank public deserve put confidence chairman GREENSPAN president broaddus MR BROADDUS mr chairman I pretty much bob parry tough call I druther preference would go full ½ point would decisive move would preempt inflation expectation might either build likely build nearterm future I recognize would strong move particularly context need asymmetry whatever do ; I agree fully point score I recognize risk big risk might get market break could lead I would refer disorderly plunge stock market would complicate situation make difficult we take kind step need to135 take I able accept ¼ point increase morning I would hope I might call " asymmetry plus " need language also I would hopeand I expect you have incline testimony far roadthat underscore intensity watch development readiness move aggressively fact need also I hope line I would hope board governor might consider complementary discount rate increase near future furthermore I agree bob parry I know intermeete conference call always table context remark I hope watch market development carefully signal call chairman GREENSPAN governor gramlich MR gramlich first datum point : I talk yesterday difference tenyear bond nominal real spread I match develop synthetic yield chairman GREENSPAN I do n't colleague end table MR gramlich I use chart exhibit 18 staff send around every monday render certainly last month rise inflation premium don kohn persuade I way overstate yesterday nevertheless go second thing I would like say I tend agree bluebook simulation inflation target humble model I believe likely need lot tighten real question deal today get here136 I support recommendation 25 basis point move tilt implicit gradualism I recognize benefit strategy I be delight think strong silent leader laughter I think make good point mr chairman economy many way fragile thing could change rather abruptly past record good call turn therefore chance could overreact regard I think tilt connection roger ferguson ’s work group one thing I like tilt easily reversible raise rate 50 basis point discover much reduce 25 basis point would look though do n’t know 25 basis point tilt new datum come indicate economy strong think take tilt look know we be we be look datum that be nice advantage tilt I be glad use situation number benefit gradualism strategy I recognize I support recommendation say cost gradualism strategy could move little late historical precedent I think ought keep mind chairman GREENSPAN president jordan MR jordan thank I look financial market tellingly meor maybe importantly tellingly mei see treasury yield curve upward slope bit two year five year beyond five year it be downward slope corporate bond yield mortgage rate 8 percent I would hard press say wrong level environment outline greenbook associate expectation I would feel much firm ground say something wrong with137 market level give secondhalf experience 534 percent real growth depend inflation measure nominal spend 712 8 percent I think do n’t add say market build kind real growth plus inflation inherit second half last year year I do n’t know nominal interest rate need go inflation turn adversely accelerate seem build marketplace right inflation expectation begin rise I think would undesirable real rate go I would think nominal rate would need increase front end curve though I look rise rate security mature two year leave feel 512 percent overnight interbank rate low consistent close gap somewhat would wise thing take step today I think appropriate I comment though question 50 basis point versus 25 basis point require make reference discount rate time I think still case movement fund rate accompany increase discount rate interpret last move oppose move fund rate alone give I would think 50 basis point increase fund rate discount rate change strong since I consider director ' recommendation discount rate increase appropriate environment I would prefer ¼ point fund rate know accompany discount rate move fact I would oppose 50 basis point change fund rate either discount rate increase without chairman GREENSPAN board governor meet later vote discount rate president guynn138 MR GUYNN thank mr chairman I come meet intention inclination argue 50 basis point tighten I think staff presentation hear yesterday comment make around table would certainly support I believe evidence mount inflationary pressure probability inflation move clearly increase view big worry consensus go 50 basis point tighten would inclination slide back balance risk statement eloquently point want I support ¼ point tighten today balance risk side inflationary pressure I guess already answer question let say I would really like see board consider discount rate increase I think give director ownership policy action reinforce action take view reasonably high probability step pace term policy action meeting come I support recommendation chairman GREENSPAN president moskow MR MOSKOW thank mr chairman table today ’s wall street journal I do n’t know many people see list series possible fed action today give odd likely market reaction different scenario we have talk aboutan increase fund rate 25 50 basis point tilt without last line table rate cut fed odd " as likely cub win world series " laughter likely market reaction " holy cow " laughter I find upset obviously chance go lower rate today cub fan always optimistic139 mr chairman I support recommendation strongly I think strategy incremental move excellent one support market right help confirm inclination seem clear move today would jeopardize expansion would also jeopardize credibility well important I note outlook assume fed fund path decidedly upward drift forecast horizon even strong upward tilt project deterioration inflation outlook regardless whether look core PCE core CPI measure I mention yesterday inflation still go judgment increase 25 basis point go enough forecast horizon I believe say think series move make sure correct imbalance aggregate demand aggregate supply I think it be also important say balance risk tilt high inflation exactly reason explain articulately chairman GREENSPAN president minehan MS minehan thank mr chairman one thing I come meet determine end asymmetric directive whether go 25 50 basis point increase fund rate I be glad appear go I imagine people give think I might recommend meet would think I would clearly side 50 basis point move I must admit I be frequent debate much demand side equationi do n’t think anybody doubt strength demandbut element supply richly portray don kohn ’s different graph I be
