productivity assumption difference part story propelling permanent income growth higher affecting stock market forecastsmacro advisors example explicit piecesare still anticipating decline stock prices instances think forecasts analysis investments taking account large component replacement investment investment forecast believe consensus housing we’re stronger consensus we’ve consensus partly analysis good backlog orders wealth effects might significant think conditions still place elements private final demand little stronger picture somewhat stronger view underlying fundamentals many instances folks rising stock prices still weaker demand it’s hard CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN that’s inconsistent32 MR PRELL one different coefficients different view wealth effects one attribute less strength consumption demand normal wealth effects spate mortgage refinancing last year erratic elements recognize crowd hard pressed given analysis come conclusion materially lower point MR MEYER give interpretation staff somewhat different perspective private forecasts think main difference staff strong view interaction supply demand common force productivity affecting demand supply think proven accurate one doesn’t see perspective private forecasts forecasters revise productivity growth estimates get demand impact changes whole dynamic CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN think exactly right fact risks staff forecast may well side probability forecast low means negligible MR PRELL might say terms signs strong demand received preliminary reading january auto sales seem come almost 18 million units179 millionfor light vehicles well rate anticipating first quarter combination construction data morning means we’ve two pieces much stronger spending data built greenbook forecast CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN president jordan33 MR JORDAN thank questions international side may question dave stockton’s presentation simulations chart 15 first karen chart 10 think kinds simulations interesting want get say bit scenario might least consistent exercise went see lot references idea united states become debtor nation external liabilities growing i’ve probably even talked way occasion know lot holdings foreigners source capital inflowsthe counterpart large maybe growing current account deficitconsists assets perspective foreign investors denominated dollars may think debt asset holdings literally dollars assume way accounting done last year foreigners increased holdings US currency 30 billionor whatever number counted part debt part financing going MS JOHNSON balance payment statistics logged way huge number yes counted debt MR JORDAN getting pretty big depending rest world regard socalled dollarization get quite large don’t know much russians alone acquired last year dollardenominated assets foreigners hold whether cds types deposits banks mutual funds debt securities equities kinds investment vehiclesare counted part debt part sense really debt buy uncle sam’s debt debt instruments governments corporations united states debt whether held domestic foreign investors34 appropriately extent receiving end basis anecdotal reports increasing volume direct foreign investments kindsacquisitions companies including example supermarket chains banking chains may increase suppose superimpose simulations two extremes 1 increase foreign holdings dollardenominated assets really uncle sam’s debt 2 extreme equity investments portfolio investments direct investments kind draw different conclusions implications exchange rate dollar MS JOHNSON reading step truly piece paper MR JORDAN know MS JOHNSON step notion number gets large inevitably consequences people’s willingness hold dollars produce 25 percent devaluation 5 percent devaluation whatever analysis model able rely works one side process says dollar X Y implication current account balance answer questionnot simulation draw reacting think goingi say true capital account important piece story desire foreigners invest united states participate gains productivity developments occurred united states think lie behind developments seeing evident fact much time deficit wideningover past three years let’s saythe dollar rising means capital account going direction time current account going way might lead one take comfort notion people35 find attractive instruments buying united states believe asset valuations US financial markets sound reason think going change hurry time taken face value open gap GDP GNP big deal although imagine politicians make lot noise principle nothing economics gap GDP GNP troublesome well imagine world making rational appropriate allocation global savings major economy productivity higher elsewhere capital accumulating capital owned foreigners owned residents united states problem continue time don’t think anything form foreign investment takeswhether portfolios direct investmentsthat necessarily assures continue that’s foreigners reasonpolitical economic rational irrationalto decide unhappy exposure US economy avail financial instruments either decrease exposure hedge one readily hedge foreign direct investment selling financial assets short view protected oneself certain kinds exchange rate developments certain kinds economic developments case form capital enters united states necessarily implies anything future behavior put forward warning flagi don’t deny thati think necessarily implies dollar come pressure tomorrow next day next year also say nothing automatic forms capital inflows work future change investor sentiment toward holding claims united states36 MR JORDAN okay accept thatand nothing simulation suggests change imminent let come question slightly different way i’m trying understand better let’s start panel lower left exercise involves assumption dollar devalued 25 percent first reaction say “okay thats useful exercise go through” started thinking fact dollar declining 25 percent value time period currencies rising 25 percent dollar can’t imagine currency might actually happen MS JOHNSON ill submit euro guess ill throw laughter MR JORDAN youll never convince CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN cuban peso laughter MS JOHNSON think problem japanese economy confronting i’m personally quite pessimistic japan dont think anything positive going happen time soon people buying japanese equities clearly feel differently felt people putting upward pressure yen feel differently japanese economy might appear restructuring recovering might appear offer returns road quite attractive nonetheless japanese current account surplus means exchange rates interest rates japanese investors persuaded acquire net claims rest world every monthno matter whatgoing forward daunting thought one might well believe going hard japanese economy begins recover MR JORDAN maybe japanese ricardians let ask dave stockton question chart 15 may interesting scenarios gets back think to37 governor meyer’s comment simulation differences forecast models staff’s model scenario 1 staff’s model wouldn’t case least partial analysis given acceleration productivity corresponding increase real GDP growth deceleration inherited rate inflation corresponding extent occur haveand guess model requires thisan acceleration nominal spending says don’t get productivity gains lower price level timea lower rate inflation ongoing basis rather produces increase final demand increase demand financed implicit accommodative policy part either money growth accelerates credit comes along finance greater spending velocity must change happens make things come together MR STOCKTON fact underlying assumption monetary policy accommodates stepup nominal GDP increase money growth go along obviously shortrun scenario think simulations presented bluebook tried give flavor case midst acceleration productivity equilibrium real funds rate go along effect says hold another two years experience period unemployment rate declines even inflation rate basically stays end two years need ultimately sense funds rate entire structure interest rates move higher longer term order sustain low inflation MR JORDAN okay butand think important pointthe simulation allow real interest rate move equilibrium level dont let the38 inflation rate come way model works don’t get automatic increase real rate come along deceleration inflation therefore real rate rise future get things back balance MR STOCKTON constant federal funds rate scenario small increase real federal funds rate slightly lower inflation rate point exactly correct MR JORDAN okay thank CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN president parry MR PARRY karen question japan recently finance ministry indicated might borrowing 21 percent opposed issuing 10year bonds cost 16 percent questions try sound objective asking first astute financial strategy given financing second chapter 2 speak capital injection banking system suggest perhaps banks really turned corner japan must admit seems reallyto use neutral term“interesting” time longterm postal savings deposits coming due renewed 25 percent finance ministry going borrow banks narrow private group 21 percent seems cause tremendous political problems MS JOHNSON information new york times article read talked among staff tried figure various hypotheses understand going though cant distinguish among put particular stew fact bank japan announced busy selling bills market short run absorb excess39 liquidity ministry finance says trying mobilize funds view sitting around banking system nothing havent admitted sort approach credit crunch situation see funds sitting going utilize resources propose borrow provide local governments funds obligated provide budget provisions already exist essence borrowing banking system finance right alternative presumably issue japanese government bonds jgbs one might imagine banks taken idle funds provided bought jgbs 4 basis points MR PARRY right MS JOHNSON one possibility way give banks bit income one might ask whether ministry finance thinks relatively attractive instrument banks provide financing direct JGB route said done sense ministry finance going able expand amount financing oneforone swap appear books effect policy implication ministry finance might actually less financing open market consequence issued instrument particularly attractive banks thereby increasing willingness banks hold claims japanese government case ministry say yes paid bit actually sold market JGB market otherwiseif sell much sell nothing else going onthis crazy scheme point view ministry finance guess40 A couple things worry one seems odds bank japan another concern jgbs sitting going sell enormous capital losses japanese longterm rates really move end banking system put large amount capital barely gotten effect banking system fixed means economy recover deal cycle debt creating undercuts process putting capital losses books japanese banks instruments presumably wont trading market wont marked market wont show capital losses least wont show time soon going selling rates market anyway may way trying improve bank balance sheetsa way giving returns 2 percent instead 2 basis pointsbecause going need 41 MR PARRY thank CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN president stern MR STERN thank question simulations well mike greenbook shows baseline simulation flat funds rate simulation look analysis seems imply sacrifice ratio one bluebook sacrifice ratio much worse trying understand causes difference different assumptions credibility expectations formed dont know MR KOHN different time period sacrifice ratio bluebook calculated full ten years lags work might different short run long run MR STERN really involves difference 8 percentage point 1 difference unemployment rate 7 difference PCE price number MR PRELL short run exchange rate dynamics exaggerate response that’s probably important element getting effect big MR STERN right let ask bluebook sacrifice ratio don’t know credibility assumption seems really high MR KOHN little higher weve past much consistent model looking longer run fairly high sacrifice ratio think compared models bounds baseline simulation next two years 1 percent plus NAIRU gap small upward creep inflation implies pretty high sacrifice ratio that’s great unemployment rate NAIRU doesn’t result much upward creep inflation obviously want lower inflation lot NAIRU long time get inflation to42 come sacrifice ratio intended consistent basic story greenbook terms fast inflation accelerate next years given assumed output gap it’s important recognize lot things going greenbook scenario price shocks oil prices moving forth analysis tries abstract get underlying slope phillips curve MR PRELL one things pointed repeatedly model simulations output path generated different stock market assumption versus different monetary policy assumption much larger expectational effects monetary policy case quite plausible fed perceived nothing face decline unemployment rate acceleration prices peoples inflation expectations marked considerably change expectations exaggerate effects kind scenario generate significant decline dollar exchange markets exacerbates inflationary effect CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN president poole MR POOLE want go back chart 10 karen looks though assumed exogenous change endogenous variable that’s something spent 30 years trying tell students MS JOHNSON used partial equilibrium model okay laughter MR POOLE im speechless laughter MS JOHNSON nothing simulations intended suggest dollar react cause changes dollar simply statement says foreign growth US growth potential best know the43 dollar follow path outcome current recovery nothing meant predictive drives dollar MR POOLE guess question one learn experiment nature it’s partial equilibrium involves whole lot things dont add model internally inconsistent MS JOHNSON think one learn analysis believe return stronger vigorous growth abroad solve external balance problem united states mistaken unless parameters relate trade near term determinants change lot change soon case resumption foreign growth effect closing US external gap MR PRELL contradicts degree saying earlier comparison various forecasts look outside forecasts many net export balance reaching nadir sometime yeareither flattening turning kind pattern able understand given analysis elasticities involved yet people still seem notion minds strength foreign economies result import elasticity isn’t strong seems CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN president hoenig MR HOENIG mike dave respect simulations let ask something think hinted around edges two three previous questions greenbook prepared last time december meeting assumed increase 75 basis points funds rate works greenbook increase 125 basis points one looks simulations analysis suggests behind curve44 unless scenario 1 occurs let ask think odds scenario 1 materializing everything else suggests behind curve MR STOCKTON sure characterize scenario 1 quite way characterized fact one argueand think may president jordan arguingthat scenario 1 fall behind curve sense even though inflation picking unemployment rate falling even equilibrium indeed real federal funds rate falling even longrun equilibrium scenario enjoying another period sustained strong economic growth low inflation still fair amount work done scenario 1 terms adjusting policy point road order bring funds rate back equilibrium inherit lower rate inflation going process certainly something benefits good news twoyear period still policy tightening done road fact longerrun bluebook simulations showing terms probabilities one judge probability scenario 1 staff forecast errors recent years one might say entirely implausible laughter obviously think relatively balanced set risks forecast seen chart 14 recent observation shows productivity still accelerating entirely clear probabilities split right middle scenario 1 scenario 2 MR HOENIG that’s interesting thank MR MEYER follow judging probability might want indicate path investment model produce capital45 deepening required achieve scenario given capital deepening generating uptick trend productivity MR STOCKTON true particular scenario faster productivity growth generated part rapid multifactor productivity growth we’ve there’s addition capital deepening factors working MR PRELL underscore point hope saw prefomc briefing yesterday multifactor productivity trend pales comparison experienced long periods countrys economic history well component better productivity performance MR MEYER yes that’s almost pulling something hat way seems big story increase capital deepening want play story think need trace needed get much capital deepening produce acceleration productivity MR PRELL one thought investment merely prelude putting place efficient operations one might say payoff multifactor productivity still lies ahead one wants new wave optimist certainly possible come stories assumptions generous feel reasonably balanced scenario baseline forecast obviously far optimistic forecasters large yet think sensible look prospects CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN interesting interplay karen saying larry said strength dollar face widening current account deficit apparently consequence increasing rate return facilities46 related capital deepening relationship fairly strong least immediate forecast tie among simultaneous simulations lots things occurring pull one string whole thing unravels MR PRELL grab onto one string though possible buoyancy dollar something might argue bubble situation equity market people may exaggerated ideas prospective returns investments CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN foreigners MR PRELL domestic foreign investors foreigners playing role investing perceive profitable US ventures CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN shall break coffee gets frozen VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH may add one comment related going back karens chart 10 great deal work current account deficit percentage GDP way work we’ve done driven notion given almost reasonable pattern one assumes world economy current account deficit percentage GDP continues worsen one goes deep concern sheer terror prospect question arises possibly done one comes questions like “what happens 25 percent devaluation” analysis done indicates continuing worsening current account deficit inevitable ifrationally irrationally karen suggestedforeigners decide dont want hold assets go back peter fishers presentation look happened euro everybody thought wonderful invest unhedged euro assets sudden decided wasnt good idea period a47 couple days hedges went nobody sell underlying assets hedged drives home validity point karen making little distinction foreign direct investment bonds bank deposits anything else foreigner decides doesnt like dollar assets derivatives market gets deep immediate opportunity something way world predict might happen certainly seems clear present danger dont know whether happen eight years eight days tomorrow morning never least likely prospect never happen seems something clearly taken serious consideration CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN herb stein said “if things can’t continue wont" VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH right wont CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN let’s coffee coffee break CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN questions colleagues somebody like start committees discussion president jordan question MR JORDAN i’m volunteering start discussion banks district reported commercial consumer loan demand remained strong nearly early weeks new year mortgage area refinancing activity dried completely mortgage loan

appears continuing fall orders domestic production rising steel price increases already implemented increases announced go effect april 1 see whether market withstand increases let make couple comments national economy global economy terms context we’re making policy decisions thoughtand im sure everyone agreethat chairmans speech january 13th outstanding framework thinking environment find provides basis dialogue inside system well outside system broader implications of49 challenge monetary stability overall concept includes call price stability encompasses much challenge try maintain sort equilibrium message rest world hopeful one nations may best early stages experiencing kind productivity gains past several years places around world get type reinforcing virtuous cycle may help work deep longlasting problems message us acceleration productivity occurred get full effects passed sustained drop price level get automatic increase real interest rate might otherwise happened

arent signs happen instead consumption booming confidence high saving rate even lower trade deficit higher consumers borrowing nonfarm nonfinancial corporate debt certainly still affordable growing rapidly hitting rather high levels least relative GDP im glad see forecast greenbook idea economy slow appears abandoned greenbook projects substantial policy tightening necessary bring economy back reasonable balance demand supply various aspects supply remain question however least view longerterm alternatives greenbook bluebook rate growth potential output around 4 percent near termthe next two five yearsand NAIRU somewhere around 514 percent must admit though bluebook confess fair amount uncertainty latter however bluebooks alternatives clearly illustrate assumptions potential labor market capacity constraints possible perhaps reasonable part remain somewhat agnostic whether productivity continue grow next five years pace last two three years think least near term NAIRU might lower board staff’s estimate amount tightening 2000 growth slowing our55 estimate potential 312 percent soslower greenbook forecastbut nearly results terms prices unemployment course assumptions possible well one take optimistic view growth potential NAIRU make case little tightening needed bring demand supply balance take view believe run increasing risk imbalances look household corporate balance sheets see growing liabilities debt service burdens reasonable one factors growing market values assets relatively low debt service costs goes without saying economy increasingly vulnerable changes market perceptions market prices interest rates appears economy increasingly buys idea things go one direction takes major risk face thinking economic forecasts risk policy actions taken tighten credit conditions may cause large market reactions affect US balance sheets cause foreign inflows markets decline well greenbook forecast moved away assumption policy tightening cause market values decline stock market flattens turn personally think reasonable assumption based experiences late 1980s 1990s figures forecast well many ways ideal outcome think wise bit agnostic regard well

generally holiday shopping season exceptionally good district retailers inventory levels beginning year described rational excessive thus requiring little aggressive promotional activity january also steel industry particular benefiting strength autos appliances consumer durables steel order books said solid showing little tapering demand january similar jerry jordan said earlier difficult

GREENSPAN president guynn MR GUYNN thank mr chairman southeast region healthy balanced expansion continues final data conversations retailers tell us holiday selling season blockbuster one clearly exceeded expectations even early estimates tourism often gives us good reading on60 discretionary spending reported popular press measurable slowdown tourism special yearend period advanced bookings spring quite strong suggesting strength reporting sector resume hear mixed views people talk much slowdown seeing housing certainly tightening moves rise mortgage rates effect markets housing construction remains high levels inventory unsold units quite low nonresidential construction actually increased somewhat overall manufacturing activity region shown pickup production new orders strength attributed domestic demand rather significant pickup exports despite recovery many economies around world still hearing sharp trade imbalances talk people run ports saying lopsided cargo trade caused operational problems surcharge fees outbound containers sent back US empty regional payroll rose 212 percent year year reflects even strength national numbers labor markets feel tighter tighter last week new restaurant owner telling operating half capacity several weeks inability hire enough cooks servers general manager told concerned able maintain high quality service top rating marginal staff hire time still told employers stubbornly trying hold line broadbased wage increases period since last meeting one gets sense prices edging prices construction materials 2 5 percent copper prices 1061 percent red meat prices 7 8 percent herd liquidations last two winters kinds price increases top talked doubledigit increases energy health care pharmaceuticals getting peoples attention working way indexes regional economy strong resource price pressures seem building nationally see much picture late last year clear national economy great momentum latest data even stronger expected dont see much evidence yet earlier policy tightening moves dented strong consumer demand economy us noted relatively strong growth elsewhere world seems sure put pressure domestic producers addition congressional temptation spend pushes direction dont like direction price movements reflected greenbook’s baseline forecast VAR forecast paints similar picture forecast suggests CPI inflation approach 3 percent year virtually probability 2 percent forecasts suggest even several tightening moves wont damp upward drift inflation great degree believe even argue beginning see whites inflations eyes think tightening called clearly priced markets validating market expectations task one instances undermine credibility thank mr chairman CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN president boehne62 MR BOEHNE thank mr chairman regional economy philadelphia district strong retailing manufacturing construction operating high levels labor markets remain tight amount overtime starting become political issue labor relations committee pennsylvania house representatives example recently held hearings issue overtime construction workers concluded significant overtime reduces productivity raises safety concerns believe hear people becoming stretched long workplace think going next qualityoflife issue probably work political campaign 2000 although wage increases remain generally moderate one hear stories higher salaries used entice people switch jobs national economy continues grow robustly consumer spending particular growing rapidly although productivity also rising smartly sense demand pressing much supply unless growth demand moderates coming months expansion risk concern Y2K largely behind us need return main task prolonging sustainability remarkable expansion sometimes prolonging expansion requires lowering interest rates sometimes requires holding steady sometimes current situation requires raising task coming months raise rates manner contribute stability avoiding initiating instability CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN president broaddus MR BROADDUS situation district similar one jack guynn others described rest southeast accounts economic activity expanded strongly since meeting december consumer spending especially63 strong holiday season remained robust january information strong car sales consistent number mike prell mentioned earlier manufacturing activity also remains robust apart textiles seen moderationi guess that’s way put itin residential commercial construction sales bad weather got whale moderation snowstorm last week overall think slowing fairly modest point reflects supply constraintsshortages workers construction materials delays planned new construction including putting place infrastructure also ultimately reflecting supply constraints regional information struck recent weeks labor markets prices dont want belabor tight labor market theme increasing difficulty finding qualified workers across broad range service manufacturing industries really key preoccupation business contacts addition construction workers nurses teachers especially tight supply moment environment ed boehne mentioned district hearing reports significant wage salary increases regular monthly survey manufacturers respondents report expect much broader acceleration wages next several months two three months ago regarding prices years received innumerable reportscomplaints actuallyabout lack pricing power perhaps bit different cathy minehan saying new england sense may eroding somewhat region A businesspeople maybe telling us openly feel pricing flexibility say year ago dont want exaggerate this64 point sizable price increases still widespread area pricing atmosphere put way seems changing bit far national picture concerned forecast close greenbook forecast except inflation prediction core PCE inflation rate unlike bob mcteer little higher rather lower strong forecast still think risks primarily side thats point seems underscored data received friday data released today mike prell mentioned earlier always hard time separating discussions economic outlook discussions policy problem related way meetings organized find case especially meeting context found various simulations greenbook bluebook helpful interesting trying disentangle things want make comments ill wait tomorrow kohn gives briefing bluebook policy alternatives thank CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN president hoenig MR HOENIG thank mr chairman tenth district economy changed appreciably since last meeting balance remains healthy overall labor markets remain tight wage pressures though increasing increasing dramatically tell agricultural sector continues pretty much low prices high subsidies making outlook sector appear fairly stable one thing might mention expansion rural america really shared good times job growth region nearly high nation average course scenic recreational areas substantially stronger we’ve good uniform growth jobs across rural areas well65 let talk little bit oil sector even sizable increases oil prices effects levels activities region relatively modest far talking director industry said industry right still budgeting capital budgets around 18 per barrel oil feel OPEC manage maintain price 20 30not wanting go 30 spark interest among oil producers seems forestalling price watching developments terms adjusting capital budgets around numbers price levels unless see accelerating price level judgment exploration budgets won’t increase dramatically let mention another local anecdote kansas city southern railway runs railroad texas monterey way mexico city visiting head company last week told volume traffic railroad last 18 24 months increased good 50 percent directions said striking much business capital investment made along railroad said state technology manufacturing plants good gets quality products coming good gets interestingly though also noted shipments finished goods intermediate goods also expanding dramatically along route people’s incomes prospects improve may sign positive things come let turn national economy basically i’m convinced US economy experiencing effects excess demand based evidence pressures probably building projections strong board staff it’s matter degree direction see greater likelihood demand increase continue to66 outpace supply even though signs supply side good view put increasing pressure prices situation complicated bit refer “imbalances” also persisting levels debt rising current account deficit increasing well suggests perhaps room us think increasing rates modestly minimum response i’ll stop thank CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN president stern MR STERN thank mr chairman district economy remains strong won’t go details except comment things changed process changing district five things want mention briefly first banking side bankers report continuing compete aggressively loans butand “but” tightening credit standards report encountering examiners encouraging tighten credit standards second glut office space coming may year two three least district think it’s pretty well baked cake right third labor markets course remain tight starting see upcreep rate increase wages frequency wages going fourth far inflation concerned run survey annually year’s results versus last year’s results show deterioration inflation outlook respondents expect inflation 3 percent year formerly case firms report planning raise prices case last year whether pricing plans reflect wishful thinking whether firms make price increases stick course remains seen finallyand first time i’ve heard commentdevelopers especially residential real estate developers expressing67 concerns interest rate levels starting believe higher rates affect business year beyond national level views really haven’t changed quite time think well positioned significant growth real economy whether turn 312 percent 4 percent even don’t know growth range looks pretty good bet i’m much less confident outlook inflation may see meaningful acceleration inflation say i’ve said i’m entirely persuaded labor market indicators good precursors likely developments inflation scene course one reasons though reason really can’t say much outlook productivity CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN vice chair VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH mr chairman second district’s economy began new year strong upward momentum despite ongoing cost increases housing manufacturing consumer price inflation actually decelerated slightly unemployment rates new jersey new york state new york city fell 10year lows yearend private sector job growth accelerated 36

restaurants missing 20 orders next morning confronted restaurant manager ask wasn’t better job small anecdotes lead one believe upside potential productivity gains may real unfortunately supply demand side effect doesn’t make jobs easier view matter great concern indicated remark made coffee break think face clear danger growing current account deficit percentage GDP anything tells us committee carry responsibilities wisely steadily well that69 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN strikes cows need privacy act laughter governor ferguson MR FERGUSON it’s hard follow though might say administrative governor want find machines laughter staff discuss later serious vein end last meeting stated review incoming data closely signs imbalances data we’ve received date suggest economy continuing expand faster pace potential even potential gone mike brought recent data automobile sales strong recent ECI data even though measurements flawed understand suggest vigilance important similarly latest information regarding personal income outlays suggests consumers continue willing spend beyond incomes giving credibility optimistic survey numbers also worries regarding imbalances respect recent GDP numbers think well educated staff done independent analysis discovered fact relatively agnostic numbers ones suggest strengthening economy earlier discussion regarding forecast regard i’d like make two observations one staff expect shortfall earnings widening corporate financing gap implicitly high volatility equity markets well noticeably higher interest rates suggests inconceivable expected returns investment might weaken conjunction amount of70 investment might weaken leads one small internal inconsistency perhaps greenbook though understand got similarly greenbook suggested significant increase short term interest rates also suggested spite equity markets tread water sense ending year pretty much level started year growing concern placid surface may disguise underlying turmoil think dispersion saw among various indices beginning year may suggest market subject volatility including significant downside corrections considerations meant way counter various recitations strength economy heard discussed today probably hear course day along others certainly think risks good economic performance primarily side equilibrium interest rates probably higher current market rates however others suggested think prepared move policy incrementally use tools carefully mind president boehne put correctly goal attempt maintain maximum sustainable growth well try focus price stability believe entering particularly challenging year economy may prove “interesting” sense chinese proverb thank CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN governor gramlich MR GRAMLICH thank mr chairman staff always serves us well believe done particularly time appreciate inflationtargeting exercise done bluebook think theres lot learn know recently become interested approach monetary policy possible means dealing71 policy age productivity shocks tried put thinking words speech gave earlier month reactions around building interesting like inflation targeting say whats big deal already others say way ever fortified consensus laughter unlike al broaddus wait tomorrow talk bluebook laughter find exciting i’m going try draw three lessons exercise first lesson think fairly obvious one since unemployment rate well structural estimate NAIRU incipient inflationary pressures pressures counteracted fairly sharp early rise funds rate something think we’ve less suspected staff exercise still valuable showing high funds rate required stabilize inflationsomething like 7 percent course assumes models literally correct may want assume think take note general point second lesson preemption good suspected staff exercise shows inflationtargeting funds rate rise another full percentage point wait see actual acceleration hence get behind curve waiting lead larger variations funds rate ounce prevention worth pound cure third point present circumstances reversals seem least relatively unlikely staff exercise assuming NAIRU 4 percent none professional forecasters larry meyer recently surveyed paper prepared go low though 4 percent within normal statistical distribution estimates estimate recent paper brainard parry sake argument staff assumes 4 percent right number works back optimal monetary policy72 still get funds rate rising 6 percent near future hence even make early tightening moves oldfashioned date view NAIRU probability seems relatively slight eat crow reverse moves one also inflation targeting i’ll call pipeline method looking prices lead final goods prices PPI one measure rose rapidly third quarter pretty stable since actually decelerating late 1999 impact oil removed much true import prices think bound rise point time seem relatively stable commodity prices reversed downward movements beginning trend even apart oil commodity futures chairman often told us single important number unit labor costs based combination wage costs productivity evidence still reassuring recent ECI number suggests nonwage labor costs may trending still less increase labor productivity point unit labor costs rising less rapidly fact nearly stable chairmans important number think also reassuring number pile data gotten intermeeting period outandout inflationary spiral rabbit wage increases beats turtle productivity increases every time far turtle ahead next lets look forecasters saying blue chip forecasters actually pretty mellow individuals average predicting rise inflation either final goods producer goods predicting increases interest rates seems inflation prediction based assumed policy tightening presumably without tightening predicting acceleration michigan the73 philadelphia fed surveys forecasts prices also rising slightly case impossible tell monetary policy forecasts based hard read evidence let’s look bond markets evidence think worthy attention example interest rates 10year bonds nominal real recently changed noticeably year ago TIP real yield slightly 4 percent nominal yield 412 percent noticeably skittish bond market time building little inflation premium real yield gone 43 percent even latest drop nominal yield way 66 percent 10year bonds bond market building pretty hefty inflation premium presumably due current inflation 23 percent soa major change last year potential undoing flight quality around turn year may partially complicate analysis treasury buyback program rising expectations inflation must prominent factor obvious implication inflation may returning key economic phenomenon motivating bond markets something think none us like happen watch inflationtargeting perspective model bond market seem vote tightening forecasters hard read think pipeline method signals abstention finally like look conditions ill call equilibrium perspective stable growth economy inflation rates settled staff’s target 2 percent term premium bonds close zero real rate TIP bonds alluded 43 percent financial people think roughly 40 basis point liquidity premium TIP bonds given thin market compared comparable nominal bonds hence adjusted real interest rate might 39 percent even with74 stable expectations 2 percent inflationan inflation rate lucky achieve according staffthe equilibrium level nominal shortterm rates order 59 percent stable growthstable inflation economy present rates bit south think us view feeling balance risks like balance realigned key question think ed boehne mentioned quickly realign gracefully realign thank CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN president poole MR POOLE mr chairman i’ll brief dont anything report st louis district adds already heard around table contacts fedex UPS confirm vigorous economies asia air cargo capacity coming asia united states fedex ups talking adding capacity united states firms find fourth quarter better anticipated A survey customers potential new customers fedex indicates vigorous spring anticipated short time ago outlook immediate future strong also report though labor situation well control see problems either staffing labor costs undue pressures national picture simply like emphasize sense it’s lot easier imagine inflation half point higher staff forecast half point lower CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN governor meyer MR MEYER want share observations outlook shape views appropriate policy action tomorrow strategy guide us going forward given uncertainty face trend growth NAIRU inflation dynamics we’ve balance risk might fail take full advantage higher75 trend growth lower NAIRU risk overheating higher inflation increased economic instability probed limits new possibilities risk overheating increased first observation risks become significantly tilted toward higher inflation judgment based still robust growth already high labor utilization rate dissipation reversal favorable relative price shocks restraining inflation signs incipient pressure nominal compensation inflation consistent upward revisions trend growth growing appreciation importance higher productivity growth explaining recent macroeconomic experience key challenge monetary policy today derives persistent imbalance growth supply demand perspective monetary policy absolute value trend growth gdpwhether 312 334 4 percent whateveris less important relative growth rates demand supply higher trend productivity growth appears simultaneous effects demand well supply via investment boom take advantage profitable opportunities via consumption boom driven surge equity values perhaps expectations higher permanent income want read sentence staff memo FRBUS model forecast prepared meeting think telling “with trend productivity growth assumed 30 percent rather 28 percent real GDP growth boosted nearly 05 percentage point 2000 04 percentage point 2001 holding nominal funds rate nominal exchange rate assumed values” 02 percent higher productivity growth results 12 percentage point faster growth basic demand thats problem think facing76 second observation focus relative growth rates absolute ones notwithstanding uncertainties comparison points need tighten despite optimism trend productivity growth inflation prospects ultimately relate balance levels actual output potential output relative growth rates continue believe output moved beyond potential inflationary consequences imbalance restrained temporary effects associated supply developments including earlier relative price shocks importantly higher productivity growth allowed economy enjoy faster growth higher level output sustainable longer term policy implication recognize serious possibilityin view likelihoodthat need encourage transition back sustainable macro conditions terms relative growth rates ultimately terms relative levels next observation rise interest rates necessary balance supply demand contain inflation risks may initially smaller usual ultimately may larger boom featuring increase trend productivity growth temporary disinflationary effect supply shock may first limit increase interest rates given productivity upturn carries increase equilibrium real rate cyclical rise rates required contain inflation may ultimately larger otherwise wicksell’s framework natural versus market rates provides useful perspective development recent productivity upturn implies increase economys natural rate unchanged market rates gap natural market rates widened monetary policy effect become stimulative monetary policy moves market rates enough close gap expansion begin slow77 final observation believe still opportunity relatively benign transition soft landingif begin journey immediately prepared implement series tightening moves importantly willing tolerate period inflation preferred rate already operating beyond potential growth trend rise inflation probably inevitable economy makes transition sustainable set macro conditions called policy path endeavors achieve called “reverse soft landing” transition potential growth potential achieved period belowtrend growth feat compelled admit never successfully accomplished nevertheless achieved precision bluebook laughter limited signs inflationary pressures may building inflation process still lot inertia may get help decline energy prices next couple years addition reverse soft landing requiring slowdown belowtrend growth extended period easier achieve without recession fast growth economy like todays slower growth economy 1970s 1980s CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN governor kelley MR KELLEY thank mr chairman afternoon getting tally final speaker let say brief words may momentum economy productivity trends place time seem continuing inflation seems change potentially close hand momentum economy clearly remains strong record highs stock market consumer confidence resulting continuing strong consumption investment spending remains high manifested rising durable goods orders backlogs unshipped goods so78 far housing collapsedperhaps supported shift adjustable rate financing mortgage rates riseand export demand rising sustainable it’s bright outlook productivity gains continue strong believe may enhanced upcoming period fallout Y2K episode millions managers proprietors economic unitslarge small profit nonprofithave attained new level awareness knowhow hightech arena that’s truly wonderful prospect concerned price level picture may changing unfavorable direction know well we’ve enjoyed superb mix rising activity declining inflation made possible mainly surge productivity productivity gains done significant help many helpful factors going away expanded much world slump recently consequently seen dollar rise helping hold import prices even went buying spree ballooned trade deficit absorbed considerable excess demand weak export demand also freed domestic capacity fill domestic demand we’ve enjoyed weak commodity prices time collapsed energy prices either ceased help us actually turned negative tenuous exception notoriously capricious energy prices may fall domestically new jobs continue createdto societys great

discussing best done maintaining healthy rate economic growth thank CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN thank lets adjourn 900 tomorrow morning meeting recessed80 february 2 2000morning session CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN good morning everyone turn bill whitesell let remind mike prell appreciate receiving changes might individual forecasts close business monday february 7 mr whitesell MR WHITESELL thank mr chairman briefing provides background committees decision regarding ranges money debt 2000 ill referring charts tables bluebook distributed separately morning 3 humphreyhawkins report last july noted growth rates monetary aggregates likely longer term price stability ranges 1999 2000 given committee members projections nominal GDP growth fact nominal GDP expanded faster range projections committee members last july monetary aggregates grew noticeably ranges M2 expanded 614 percent last year velocity declined slightly balance although M2 velocity tracked rise opportunity cost rather well second half year

market table 2 lower panel shows provisional ranges money debt 2000 selected last july along alternative adjusts money ranges faster growth potential GDP since mid 1990s committee chosen ranges monetary aggregates benchmarks money growth conditions longterm price stability historically typical velocity trends range domestic nonfinancial debt aligned projected growth aggregate provisional range debt 3 7 percent centered far staff’s projection debt growth 2000 therefore alternative setting range offered consideration may wish retain provisional ranges perhaps implicit indication public low weight placed monetary aggregates formulating monetary policy existing ranges might also selected increases productivity growth observed recent years seen likely transitory82 hand humphreyhawkins report last july noted adjustment monetary ranges might needed rapid recent pace productivity growth persisted fact exceptional strength second half 1999 nonfarm business productivity grew estimated 314 percent last four quarters light analysis productivity behavior recent years staff revised upward estimates expansion potential output committee shifted using price stability ranges mid1990s potential output growth thought around 214 percent however staff estimates potential GDP growth averaged 312 percent last four years adding perhaps 12 percentage point upward bias implicit deflator imply nominal GDP growth 4 percent rate conditions price stability ranges alternative II adjusted upward better aligned faster steadystate growth nominal GDP assuming historically typical velocity behavior shown chart 2 M2 velocity stable history M3 velocity generally trended central tendency potential output growth implied forecasts year appears 312 334 percent expansion real GDP given roughly unchanged unemployment rate growth rate potential plus estimated inflation measurement bias close midpoint ranges shown alternative II know staff revised projection potential output growth 4 percent year next though higher implied potential growth estimates outside forecasters productivity surprises generally side late uncertainties reflected idea price stability ranges rather point estimates nevertheless select adjusted ranges given alternative II humphreyhawkins report testimony clarify revision reflects faster expansion potential GDP observed recent years rather projection potential growth going forward also stated additional information suggests different pace potential GDP committee alter benchmark ranges addition report affirm adjustment ranges reflect change longrun goal stable prices signify greater weight placed monetary aggregates formulation policy CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN questions bill MR JORDAN troubled ideai know said last year repeated herethat faster productivity growth means raise money growth ranges I83 suppose 19th century discovered faster productivity growth said go dig gold faster rate nothing inherent objective price stability trying purchasing power money says favorable supply shock raise money growth objectives there’s reason cut money growth targets adverse supply shock wouldn’t i’m sure back 1970s 1980s didn’t argue lowering targets want view transitory effects acceleration productivity growth lower reported rate inflation transitory decline price level increase purchasing power money onetime decline price leveli don’t want use “D” word supply shock goes away return toward sort balanced equilibrium also don’t see follows leaving money growth ranges alone communicates important reduced weight give need change say paying attention changing mean don’t pay attention MR WHITESELL perhaps respond think absolutely right case temporary supply shock expect concept longrun steady state condition altered transitory supply shock temporary increases productivity fact believe productivity growth surge experienced last four years transitory going go away soon reason alter longrun price stability however believe permanent component increases productivity think people presumably altering expected steady state growth nominal GDP believe need84 comparable growth rates say M2 expected steady state growth nominal GDP accommodate kind steady state expansion presumably want adjusting longrun range aggregate MR JORDAN part questioning linkage saying adjust nominal growth GDP it’s sort nominal spending effect point getting yesterday regard dave stockton’s simulation clear explicit rather implicitly saying want monetary policy going “accommodative” nominal demand increases real supplyside favorable development going let’s also think implications symmetric matter surprising adverse supply shock say “let’s cut money growth targets” probably MR KOHN permanent nature certainly productivity growth shifted 1973 order achieve federal reserve’s goals stable prices maximum employment FOMC timethough goals set forth federal reserve act timeshould shifted targeted M2 growth rates question steady state nominal GDP growth steady change rate growth productivity expected persist rather onetime change consistent bill said MR PRELL sense logic applied logic got current targets it’s recalibrating targets new longerterm trend MR JORDAN agree said case ability distinguish adverse oil shock 19731974 something much later profession came view secular trend call productivity don’t know that85 ability know experiencing given time allows us make judgment committee certainly 1970s MR KOHN late right think certain extent observe going see things like oil shocks dollar appreciation depreciation excise taxes whatever might change price level see ongoing change productivity agree takes time recognize committee struggling last several years four years since appears retrospect productivity growth changed think true changing ranges saying best guess bill said permanent component change productivity reevaluate annual basis CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN isn’t issue little limited effect best judge assuming longterm M2 velocity flat effectively engaged estimating longterm nominal GDP issue ifand underline word “if”price stability goal defined falls specific range central tendency M2 strikes question whether bad prices declining words hold context rising productivity rising real growththat keep nominal samewe get declining longterm prices different issue think that’s legitimate question asking comes strictly question goal long run stipulated assume stable velocity issue implicit M2 projection don’t think complex don’t disagree word said don’t disagree word opponents said debate either raise question really problem here86 MR MEYER think issue goal stable money growth stable inflation goal stable money growth you’ll take whatever inflation comes depending upon productivity shocks CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN may okay MR MEYER may okay goal understand operate mandate achieving price stability think indicates necessarily zero inflation least stable inflation rate make choice MR WHITESELL chairman mentioned given midpoint existing range 3 percent take estimate potential output plus measurement bias implying nominal GDP 4 percent consistent price stabilitythat means aiming deflation 1 percent per year MR JORDAN agree that’s arithmetic implication start period price stability started price stability later found acceleration productivity growth one thing acceleration productivity growth we’ve started positive rate inflation somehow measured means deceleration inherited rate something moving toward price stability juncture today concerns like registered yesterday staff others afraid message changing ranges convey rather communicating going put emphasis achieving higher rate growth seem say willing accommodative acceleration inflation say accommodating faster productivity growth might even persuaded that87 right thing think message heard accommodating faster inflation CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN suppose say explicitly issue say trying find range price stability envisage potential growth risen therefore things equal ranges go objective remains several years ago MR JORDAN sure credibility say believed know people wouldn’t believe said CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN don’t believe seriousness thinkand may wrong thisthat extent raise question capacity minutes humphreyhawkins report speeches make say essentially nothing changedthat fundamentally goal price stability potential risen necessity unless change income velocity money supply goals different said it’s arithmetical truism MR MEYER think easy attribute adjustment range productivity nobody actually believes goal setting range pure price stability nobody believes goal price stability view people think accommodating higher inflation raise range CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN president parry MR PARRY question related much discussion going alternative II think said midpoint 4 percent M2 consistent shift productivity also goal price stability potential output growth 4 percent area price stability defined zero inflation guess is88 troubling nominal GDP 4 percent means goal zero GDP deflator went around table nobody give number MR WHITESELL i’m sure answers question suggesting 312 percent potential growth observed MR PARRY oh see MR WHITESELL plus ½ percent measurement bias words measured GDP deflator ½ percent true inflation zero MR PARRY well group happy i’m really happy MR KOHN that’s way ranges constructed last five years reasoning arithmetic mind committee might want think whether wants change consistent committee MR PARRY okay CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN president poole MR POOLE think explicit numbers involved good thing us suppose say longterm goal 1 percent deflator estimate 4 percent real growth potential adds 5 percent right fear however without explicit inflation goal people read 5 percentgiven prices creeping bit pressures sideas indicating going accommodate somewhat higher inflation message giving fear explicit89 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN clearly side question people read accommodating inflation argument moving think unambiguous point may case problem MR POOLE well said willing explicit longrun inflation target estimate potential growth think make argument believe i’ve said think much explicit inflation target view constructive CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN essentially saying price stability goal want numerical judgment price stability issue MR POOLE yes given i’ll call “revealed preference” way actually behaving think market believes perfectly satisfied inflation rate somewhere neighborhood right that’s little regard zero inflation properly measured taking account biases indices best guess something like 112 percent CPI 1 percent deflator taking account measurement biases pretty good estimate zero inflation really somewhat right think market believes quite happy somewhat evidenced revealed preference terms decisions made CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN governor gramlich MR GRAMLICH bought changing ranges reluctance given discussion suppose raise ranges M2 M3 point tell say debt reason changing debt range reduced federal debt what90 MR WHITESELL never interpreted debt range longrun price stability range move interpretation debt well thought desirable make interpretation three ranges consistent make longrun price stability ranges wanted debt range match M2 long periods time debt grown rates comparable nominal GDP growth take decline debt velocity 1980s seriously think experience repeated future might leave debt range right 3 7 percent interpret price stability range spoken humphreyhawkins reports past CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN president broaddus MR BROADDUS think said well mr chairman one make pretty solid argument making change don’t feel strongly believe going significant communications issue bill poole jerry jordan others pointed whole discussion good argument numerical inflation target clear nominal anchor long run think key thing background prefer stay thing bothers little certainly sense increase trend productivity growth uncertain transitory exactly magnitude don’t think argument absolutely ironclad go route try explain way going involve taking positions things quite ready take position yet don’t see particular reason CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN president guynn91 MR GUYNN like join bill poole al broaddus comments heard see considerable merit moving direction explicit inflation target don’t know whether going talk morning particularly absence target believe much smarter leave ranges alone moment think distracting much important policy work don’t think confuse message sending public moment CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN president hoenig MR HOENIG mr chairman changing ranges always dicey issue days matter say interpretations reality time talked think building consensus rising trend productivity improvements real fact willing accept thatand may notthen moving targets make sense terms consistency price stability agree jerry jordan saying might reacted productivity shocks earlier periods think things little different balance come favor raising ranges CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN president minehan MS MINEHAN thank mr chairman want go back question portion discussion page 20 bluebook talk 214 percent trend productivity growth opposed something high MR KOHN trend potential output growth committee first set targets92 MS MINEHAN oh yes excuse 212 percent trend productivity growth MR WHITESELL currently it’s 3 percent MS MINEHAN much upward revision result change NIPA numbers MR WHITESELL much actually part staff’s current estimate potential output growth mid1990sthrough second quarter 1995is still 214 percent current estimate last four years contrast 312 percent 4 percent going forward ratcheting potential output growth estimates structural productivity second quarter 1995 moved 214 314 percent beginning 1998 potential output 334 percent beginning year we’ve predicted 4 percent MS MINEHAN mid1990s potential output growth somewhere around 214 212 percent full percentage point higher MR WHITESELL estimate still second quarter 1995 potential output growth 214 percent starting year 134 percentage points higher 4 percent MS MINEHAN yes MR PRELL case we’ve done little extrapolate recent experience nearterm period thinking might want adjusted ranges one question assumption potential GDP growth want rest assumption experience past yearswhere behavior unemployment rate relative GDP example seem consistent potential output93 growth somewhere 312 percent range little higher want look forward optimistic way assumption 4 percent MS MINEHAN understand exactly want trying get handle effect NIPA revisions knew effecta tenths percentage pointfrom NIPA revisions MR PRELL A tenths came change MS MINEHAN i’m thinking communications issue MR PRELL sure MS MINEHAN portion productivity change really fallout revising numbers better way presumably result NIPA changes something help communicating reasons change MR POOLE cathy comment quickly doesn’t change nominal NIPA revisions done change split real output prices respect revisions really bear issue MS MINEHAN change productivity MR POOLE that’s right offsetting change inflation number essentially changed split nominal MS MINEHAN realize isn’t point MR PRELL forwardlooking relevant thinking bias adjustment price measure going switching one component nominal GDP wash MR WHITESELL back mid1990s think perhaps bias closer percentage point whereas it’s ½ percentage point94 MS MINEHAN it’s ½ percentage point thinking terms looking forward ranges supposed different productivity number part think different pastbecause change break price bias underlying real growththen gives us nonpolicy oriented reason making change thinking growth rate money said think people commented communications difficulty point particularly environment think outlook inflation biased side evenly biased upward bias whatever want say risks everyone around table yesterday talked underlying pressures economy don’t think anybody satisfied existing state inflation number looks okay direction likely moving difficulty communicating reasoning change ranges tend say something willingness accommodate conditions exist right nowunless people said want get lot precise MR WHITESELL terms communications issue president minehan inform public last july change ranges might coming adjustments assessment productivity MS MINEHAN know CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN governor ferguson MR FERGUSON thank mr chairman walked really quite agnostic issue know matter people feel strongly interested hearing sides come conclusion perhaps better course leave well enough alonenot make change stagefor variety reasons jack95 guynn raised one reason important course year suspect fair amount scrutiny core policy matters prefer go period explain monetary aggregate issues frankly terribly important us right secondly whole issue also come numerical inflation targeting happen one think qualitative inflation target served us well see reason open debate think course reaching decision change ranges third thing worries listen conversation also force us sense explicit committee views productivity productivity trend i’m sure hearing consistency among committee members issues finally believe lesson learned central bank colleagues around world position talk defend actions visàvis happening growth monetary aggregates particular ECB put weight money growth perhaps lambasted week week newspapers allowing M3 growth target think much better position clearly said putting much weight aggregates M3 growth may may targets frankly prefer quite clear communications enough issues need clear leave one alone course year think much better shape given things likely CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN vice chair96 VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH associate governor ferguson’s wise remarks CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN governor meyer MR MEYER well different perspective suppose must say interesting discussion far think identified two issues relevant target ranges first whether revise reflect faster rate growth trend GDP second implicit inflation target use set midpoint revised range alternative II deals first issue believe perpetuates possible misunderstanding inflation target pure price stability adjusted estimate inflation bias say possible misunderstanding committee fully discussed preferred inflation rate certainly hasn’t worked achieve consensus point strict price stability target implicit target range today might ask question really make us look like central bank focused price stability around world like central bank least transparent inflation objective think latter offer alternative III set ranges incorporates view implicit inflation target set midpoint M2 growth rate reflect i’ve called price stability plus cushion although remains lot uncertainty precise value trend GDP growth might evolve next several years think current monetary growth ranges outdated badly need revision comfortable judgment reflected alternative II ranges updated reflect assumption trend GDP growth currently 312 percent humphreyhawkins report testimony97 emphasize FOMC reconsider setting monetary aggregate ranges incoming information leads us revise estimate trend real GDP growth instead thinking monetary growth ranges carved stone use digitalsubject costless adjustments response flow new information let turn second issue undoubtedly controversial one think sending implicit message define price stability set ranges try escape reality doubt successful change ranges many people already indicated may result probing implicit inflation target clearly go exercise explicitly set ranges question present public blur logic ignore issue entirely transparent think mainand maybe onlypurpose monetary aggregate ranges today means offer implicit inflation target perhaps view today’s discussion ranges opportunity internal discussion set inflation target consistent interpretation price stability might also look discussion decision today opportunity another step direction transparency want point view subtle real difference “explicit inflation target” “inflation targeting” understand central bank conduct monetary policy achieve price stability without establishing inflation target consistent interpretation price stability given want markets help us achieve target also value explicit believe accept explicit inflation target without sign specific strategy achieving interpret “inflation targeting” be98 countries price stability mandates explicit numerical targets uniformly set ranges centered i’ve referred price stability plus cushion view appropriate option light concern deterioration cyclical performance near zero inflation zero nominal interest rate valve therefore offer alternative III range centered preferred midpoint 5 percent reflects sum 312 percent rate trend growth GDP ½ percentage point estimate bias chain measure price index GDP 1 percentage point cushion suggests 3 percent 7 percent range small step take toward explicit inflation target enhanced transparency big step committee take give alternative strategy set central range rather point bottom point consistent pure price stability upper point consistent price stability plus cushion case central tendency might 4 5 percent attaching symmetric range central tendency yield range 2 7 percent M2 analogous australian approach setting “thick” point target 2 3 percent problems particularly indecision M2 growth inside central range allow us defer precise setting midpoint consensus reached committee perhaps consultation congress CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN president moskow MR MOSKOW thank mr chairman interesting discussion practical standpoint come back exactly place last 11 times discussed make change ranges think misleading public us make change unless a99 huge education program front others said change give impression placing lot weight ranges formulation monetary policy aren’t think communications challenges significantnot insurmountable significantbecause lot people don’t accept premise economy’s potential growth rate high many people around table think days we’d explain well otherwise people going think moving ranges indicates going conducting monetary policy way view inflationary finally inflation target issue question really whether quantitative inflation target important issue think one discussed view discussed separately context monetary policy ranges something reasonable people obviously disagree disagreement around table believe important discuss really think calls separate discussion entirely CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN president stern MR STERN thank mr chairman well don’t lot add many people already observed discussed case unlike previous discussions think today arithmetically substantively case raising ranges pretty strong don’t feel strongly think communications challenge said guess communications challenge dealt think market participants get message pretty directly used vehicles available us guess judgment wrong don’t feel strongly raising ranges CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN president boehne100 MR BOEHNE governor ferguson captured views nearly completely like associate comments CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN governor kelley MR KELLEY thank mr chairman listening discussion say reversed position came morning question permanent higher rate growth perceive permanent think move alternative II note concept sustainable growth shifted meaningfully past several years seems well shift possibly either direction note good reason able recognize formally accept shifts sustainable considerable lag dynamic involves sustainable growth moves around able perceive confidence lag think run considerable risk sync lot time go chasing explicitly moving ranges around think hard explain easily misunderstood misinterpreted public see compelling reason CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN governor gramlich MR GRAMLICH thank mr chairman comment going sound bit tired apologize think transparency good i’ve said number times think well advised move general direction inflation targeting point might even try agree explicit targets think right bigger fights fight i’d soon pass particular one talk explicit targets connection monetary ranges prefer change alternative CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN president jordan101 MR JORDAN thank earlier comment period questioning mode i’ll state view talking two different things back forth times hereabout belief sustained growth productivity potential output appropriate stance monetary policy especially implied monetary growth versus acceleration productivity least separated analytically way think matter consensus going real growth order 4 percentthrough combination productivity gains labor force growthand raising ranges communicated committee progrowth one thing hard time objecting question though accelerations decelerations fair degree uncertainty happening productivity run higher risks miscommunicating policy intentions delighted think everybody productivity growth accelerated point real output growth 6 percent still necessarily conclude quickly change monetary growth assumptions that’s favorable productivity surprise nothing wrong increase purchasing power money nothing wrong manifesting distributing wealth gains society idea dollar buys know sectors industries productivity growth increasing rapidly prices falling good thing reason think prices goods services need rise faster otherwise order hit statistical measure average price changes don’t think rule idea favorable productivity developments accepted associated rising purchasing power money falling price level102 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN president mcteer MR MCTEER wish jerry hadn’t said CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN erase record start laughter MR MCTEER made misgivings regarding say agree gary stern’s ambivalence don’t feel strongly issue one way since record believing productivity gains transitory phenomenon consistency suggests guess small preference raising ranges although accept deflation way taking productivity gains well CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN president parry MR PARRY mr chairman liked governor meyer said although must admit i’d probably happier thinner cushion leads think case made alternative II keep coming back idea really much confidence forecast aggregates mean therefore probably best draw attention balance slight preference alternative either instance however think make clear targeting aggregates goal price stability defined way talked earlier CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN came room staunchly anything ranges previously least thinking possibility changing unlike lot around table think productivity changes unquestionably real anything still accelerating arguments cited difficulty communicating logic change really quite persuasive since successful defusing interest ranges question gain stirring this103 issue answer much except academic consistency dismissed materially doesn’t strike high priority among set goals general let weigh little price stability question think jerry jordan raised issue going become important wasn’t long ago considerable discussions optimum price path talked issue example price stability necessary condition economic stability fundamentally reason opted price stabilityon grounds risk premiums rise sides price stability price stability lower bounds evidence risk uncertainty almost definition yet hard argue case say highly technologically oriented economy productivity rising rapidly nominal sales profit margins reasonably stable prices however defined falling remember prices easy define certain instances visualize sales profits income since hour unambiguous unit guess measure average hourly compensation price unambiguous notion therefore price stability move high tech economy issue becomes lot trickier think realize question isn’t price stability ultimate goal can’t secondary issue subject differences measurement careful terms goals lock think point going interesting discussion issue moment must say persuaded great idea move forward somebody else better try explain isn’t going easy think raises serious questions judge discussion around table clearly desire large majority people104 keep ranges M2 M3 debt presume alternative let’s vote total alternative accordingly read appropriate language MR BERNARD reading page 28 bluebook bottom half page “the federal open market committee seeks monetary financial conditions foster price stability

fourquarter averages core inflation rates remain relatively stable effects strengthening compensation unit costs offset faster productivity even committee convinced need tighten 25 basis points eventually long see restraint built yield curve clearly inadequate costs gradual approach contemplated policy actions seem small gradualism seem advantages gives opportunity adjust trajectory actions time based new information economy financial markets flexibility might seen especially valuable much uncertainty prospective aggregate supply financial markets volatile reaction policy difficult

president parry MR PARRY i’d like hear thoughts greenbook characterizing current stance monetary policy one part greenbook reference real equilibrium funds rate 5 percent suppose calculation involves PCE chainweighted core rate less food energy tobacco recent experience suggest inflation premium maybe 112 percent one’s analysis backward looking 2 percent forwardlooking suggest bluebook saying nominal funds rate reaches level 612 7 percent policy stimulative mode bluebook saying MR KOHN bluebook extension greenbook forecast chart 3 immediately page 8 essentially saying saying stable inflation casethe109 middle line dots dashesthat funds rate gets 712 percent next two years period inflation rates rising it’s 2 percentage points real tightening 112 percentage points real tightening think message greenbook reflected alternative strategies policy clearly positioned keep inflation rising fact positioned keep inflation pressures intensifying sense unchanged funds rate unemployment rate likely fall MR PARRY increase ¼ ½ even ¾ percentage point still position basically stimulating economy providing environment inflationary pressures likely continue rise MR KOHN trying say briefing depends importantly weight put NAIRU calculation meeting important obviously market perceives going may even important terms effects economic activity it’s intermediate longerterm interest rates effect think important trajectory market perceives going reflected intermediate longerterm interest rates see though effect economic activity effects dollar presumably equity prices discount rate matters equity prices days point market built approximately 125 basis points tightening next year greenbook built MR PARRY move cautiously important communicate clearly work apparently still done110 MR KOHN that’s right think balance risks sentence designed judgment combination 25 basis point increase unbalanced risk sentence plus potentially discount rate change tend communicate one never certain markets going react MR PARRY communication probably modified much went 50 basis points MR KOHN went 50 basis points unbalanced risks sentence think communicate greater sense concern committee’s part market perceives MR PARRY greater sense concern analytical work presented us MR KOHN agree think tend communicate putting weight estimate economy operating well beyond potential unemployment rate needs rise appreciably stem inflation question whether want wait evidence fact case sense it’s strategy issuewhether want surprise markets assessment wait get evidence MR PARRY thank CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN comfortable feel simulations econometric structure simulated provided good record judging outcomes respect inflation costs like MR KOHN lot uncertainty supply side economy try communicate ran number simulations presented the111 bluebook underscore point think staff catching quickly might even ahead productivity certainly catching quickly growth productivity modified wageprice assessments effect several people remarking yesterday sacrifice ratio higher see economy effect little less inflation prone sense even taking account supply side effects rate inflation seems less sensitive output gaps might think moving quickly data allow toward best assessment supply side effects right assessment embodied simulations tried emphasize results particularly extent firming crucially dependent assessments lot uncertainty committee may want think carefully much weight puts CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN simulations statistical discrepancy MR KOHN don’t know that’s income side thing simulations believe basically done product side CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN know huge opening statistical discrepancy creating different coefficients one get using product side submit stability number outcomes getting simulations relative forecast discrepancy much larger think realize concern careful number differences small suspicion policy implications significance important recognize example raise question whether productivity improvement real112 eventually get remarks try provide evidence something unusual going one thing know apparent marked increase profit margins fourth quarter context relatively modest set increases cost structures makes difficult get around conclusion productivity growth significantly numbers giving us basically reduced widening negative statistical discrepancy want say old aficionado building econometric models know know little concerned definitiveness results give appearance reality submit models don’t forecast well deficient coefficients simulate forecast using coefficients gives one sense reality root false saying useful exercises consider terms actual numbers produce structure changes telling us one example issue larry meyer raising yesterday respect wicksellian real interest rate qualitatively important issues discuss put specific numbers say number basis points need move funds rate make system balanced ludicrous laughing hilariously serious question way models precise range error give answers tell direction rough orders magnitude presumption small changes make difference think misreads techniques MR PRELL mr chairman may make couple comments one encourage people look simulations broad sense simply directional sense think message carry even one adjusts coefficients significantly113 question statistical discrepancy many things affected affect potential output aggregate demand side equation CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN disagree factually correct MR PRELL matter mismeasurement output growth recent period something need recalibrateboth terms estimate potential well actual growth CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN changes probability sense security one underlying rates trend productivity MR PRELL true CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN assuming right second derivative positive quite period time falls zero assuming last 3 4 greenbooks MR PRELL actually case assuming second derivative positive forecast period relative recent period making assumption past 2001 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN remember forecasting fall MR PRELL that’s longterm assumption simulation yes CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN don’t want get detailed discussion it’s want make clear sometimes presumption accuracy results models produce don’t think conveys humility required want put table want seminar delighted get involved think important issue114 MR PRELL take backseat one terms humility models want close loop one thing everyone understands done projection getting sausage made fact balancing income product sides forecast actually continuing widening statistical discrepancy that’s built baseline forecast 2001 model extension effect takes board deriving structure carried future beyond 2001 based structure judgmental greenbook forecast CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN point suppose actually going direction look arguing disagree general policy focus coming greenbook happen think year going move funds rate quite significantly higher number put back head terribly different coming lot implicit intermediate period believe terribly careful notion know don’t know little concerned basically exaggerate extent knowledge readily didn’t mean digress long discussion president jordan MR JORDAN thank lot reservations national income accounts sets information use think increasingly globalized economy certainly construct starting scratch today given way see world going nevertheless it’s try torture data efforts find useful information thought useful set exercises simulations standpoint uncertain times kinds things degree uncertainty specific things varies lot people quite115 certain one thing others uncertain thing exercises least allow people rather explicit certain certain standpoint think useful occurred looking one exercise interested included involving augmented taylor rule ben mccallum written aboutessentially 1970s called taylor rule proviso clause one additional exercise curious presented going ask question characterize understanding tell close far characterization first need digress frameworks looking last three decades least we’ve essentially two competing paradigms one supply demand money somehow measured relates supply demand output unemployment rate NAIRU times empirical experiences tended favor one framework times frameworkgoing back forth reasons uncertainty looked different charts listened narratives went message took material greater confidence one leading indicatorwhether NAIRU framework money supplymoney demand framework something elsethe gradualist one afford terms smaller incremental changes policy actions less confidence one leading indicators aggressive one one might see blip new information order take policy actions might like characterization label put simulation called realizedinflation rule “bunker hill” “whites eyes” approach soon we116 see blip inflation bang move move aggressively fair message come regard one’s confidence uncertainty leading indicators MR KOHN think fair message illustrated chart 4 certain extent i’m sure gradualism part certainly relates policy success chart 4 looks realizedinflation rule one pricestability rule pricestability scenario chart 3 derived model assumes households businesses federal reserve least pretty good idea going form expectations federal reserve assumed good idea going happen future changes funds rate sense well alternative case sure going happen future inflationrule used illustrate wait see inflation sure may bad rule follow provided certain kind shocks occurring economythat favorable supply shocks secondly noted president jordan see inflationthese four quarter changes it’s one quarter’s worth inflationyou need respond fairly robustly twice robustly taylor rule respond circumstances uncertain supply side economy you’re experiencing favorable supply shocks outcomes bad certainly better act incorrect information basic message took approximately correct run successful policy responding ex post certain circumstances careful that’s case circumstances it’s good preemptive know information policy response reactive get aggressive CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN president broaddus117 MR BROADDUS suppose half comment half question premised idea simulations useful think useful especially making comparisons particular simulations i’m chart 3 want compare socalled baseline scenario stableinflation scenario baseline scenario basically incorporates tightening assumed greenbook forecast 2000 tightening 2001 begin tighten result shown bottom panel page PCE inflation rate 3 percent steady state wasn’t long ago talking core CPI imagine relationship remained terms used talk we’re talking maybe 312 334 percent inflation core CPI measure think result acceptable many peopleif anyaround table stableinflation scenario though produce better result whether acceptable everybody don’t know difference 2000 scenario baseline difference 2001 continue tightening expected order get much difference move strongly year order preempt inflation expectations raises question mind whether structure model takes adequate account credibility issues effects thought might want comment MR KOHN structure basically assumes credibility unless federal reserve changes structure assumes 2 percent target public knows 2 percent target long following policy actions flow targetso confirming period period public’s perception targetthen expectations firmly anchored happens partly follows118 response president stern yesterday sacrifice ratios fed deviates actions public expects say 2 percent target public begins change expectations gives different sacrifice ratios short run gives different effects short run public slowly learn 3 percent target instead 2 percent target 2001 think part difference nominal rates aren’t different that’s case real rates tightening 2001 gets bit ahead rise inflation real rates considerably higher 2001 large extent builds extra restraint MR BROADDUS that’s good point especially end year MR KOHN right there’s almost percentage point extra restraint end 2001 persists next year significant amount extra restraint CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN governor gramlich MR GRAMLICH said yesterday liked exercise time think humble actually added dimension humility goes productivity debate always thought whatever rate productivity positive shockthat productivity went upthat good news inflation make economy generally less inflationary larry meyer made point yesterday think right you’ve said past mr chairman link supply demand necessarily get situation illustration larry gave yesterday indicated productivity shock actually inflationary suppose neutral putting humility table think also humble even change productivity don’t necessarily know going price forecast119 MR KOHN see chart 6 positive productivity shock tend lower inflation rates short run unless targeting inflation rate hard think one needs differentiate shortrun effects longerrun effects let’s say short run productivity shock consistent dave stockton’s charts yesterday inflation tend go profit margins swelled competition drive prices time however demand feeds back lowers unemployment rate wages begin catch higher productivity end higher equilibrium interest rate approximately equal size productivity shock depends model obviously shortrun effect let run long find situation MR GRAMLICH true also forwardlooking longterm markets stock market demand effect gets telescoped front higher consumption investment demand MR KOHN mechanism model whether it’s sufficiently captured model question effect extra earnings stock prices feeding back consumptionthough may think captured last couple yearsis model CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN president parry MR PARRY two comments one you’re uncertain whether growth outcome supply shift demand shift wouldn’t nominal income rule dominate taylor rule inflation rule terms exercises like MR KOHN price shocka change price level old oil shock variety used studythen nominal income rule way taking part in120 inflation part output regard it’s much taylor rule might different dynamic path don’t think differ much ways it’s bit like discussion folks little ago nominal income rule tilted productivity growth kept old nominal income you’d start building deflation economy starting point price stability think kind supply shock occurs matters lot MR PARRY comment follows chairman said earlier seems important keep mind standard errors exercises significant must admit didn’t think case terrified outcomes instead i’m scared CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN questions let get started believe entering period considerable turbulence financial markets characteristics one expect though may never experienced upward slope general acceleration technological applications accelerating output per hour old “S” curve scenario looked theoretically never observed past current economy scurve characteristics looking macro data see companies see multiple applications lot new technologies something different happening way economy functioning differs economy observed past looking economy every day professionally since summer 1948 nothing like experience dramatically different121 leaving aside measures productivity ask reconcile behavior profit margins domestic business operations recent years price patterns seen algebraically get income side acceleration profit margins productivity see evidence moment acceleration productivity stopped second derivative latest data still positive aware evidence expansion slowing general notion significant deceleration first quarter interesting forecast onethird quarter point dont know evidence supports slower growth forecast certainly initial claims significantly orders quite strong retail markets quite strong indeed getting slowing GDP growth measured either income side product side one presume evidence slowing growth productivity alternatively evidence changes think reasonable view productivity probably still accelerating indeed examine earnings estimates security analysts including look earnings outlook companybycompany overall estimates january still rising sense forecasts longterm earnings per share still going rapidly evidence suggests productivityenhancing investments still moving since observing unusual indicated last meeting tend get statistical acrophobia accustomed seeing motor vehicle sales levels housing starts high interest rates business activity robust virtually every part economy inflation moved iota indeed total unit costs four quarters ending low seen cycle unit labor costs barely moved122 rise inflation fourth quarter shows wholly profit margins actual unit costs granted rough nature data apparently declined fourth quarter inflationary price environment inflationary cost environment look inflation expectations best measure view one derived subtracting yield inflationprotected 10year treasury security socalled synthetic 10year nominal rate get best estimate expected 10year CPI inflation number barely different today december 1997 implicit inflation expectation calculation declined asian crisis recovered spring last year absolutely flat since sure actual nominal 10year rate gone compared real 10 year rate merely reflection fact adjustment “ontherun” “off therun” rates appropriately made raised nominal rate 12 percentage point since november last year words dramatic change socalled synthetic rate nominal rate gives false view accelerated inflation expectations unless properly adjusted done staff degree illiquidity inflationindexed treasury security visàvis appropriate nominal treasury obligation seems acceleration process create problem wealth effect problem discussed past potential supply increases pari passu rise trend productivity believe still accelerating pronounced effect demand obviously rising productivity creates higher real incomes expenditures made leaving aside issue whether stock market appropriately priced rising productivity also creates rational upward adjustment longterm earnings expectations else equal result increase value stock market assets unless wealth effect123 argue case though frankly think evidence overwhelming direction increase purchasing power increase supply case recent years resulting excess demand basically met increase net trade deficit drawing new sources labor latter found draining pool currently unemployed increases participation rate immigration increasing net imports drawing new workers obviously safety valves time fill gap created excess demand drawn upon indefinitely reasons discussed previously high rates return driving technological boom also attracting dollars abroador say increasing claims united statesand held dollar essentially unchanged process go question long obviously noted minimum unemployment rate zero care whether bring notion NAIRU analysis point ultimate limit unemployment called zero sitting imbalance essentially says wealth effect nature persist indefinitely argue implies gap excess demand supply always filled without creating major inflationary pressures point making rest econometric model merely proposition wealth effect consumption accelerating productivity continue increase expected earnings question basically closes gap closes gap obviously real longterm interest rate going quite significantly putting pressure financial markets end day going swamp rate discount stock124 market virtually zero best judge slight exaggeration slight problem monetary policy works effects overall financial markets presumption 25 basis point 50 basis point even 75 basis point change overnight rate come grips supplydemand imbalance view silliness extreme overnight rate tied process direct way actually foster term structure interest rates policy actions thereby influence real longterm rates saying algebraically equivalent larry meyer saying yesterday wicksellian real rate gap difference think simply may view gap expected equilibrium real rate market rate look process disaggregated perspective order disaggregate really looking real world wicksellian world crucial issue wealth effect policy question confronts us view influence real longterm rate primary force involved process work like think power really dont kind power except extent influence markets perform strikes stage unusual situation anything going become still difficult us regard think answer kohn gave correct onenamely inflation stay short run acceleration productivity ultimately solve problem gap meaning acceleration productivity leads continued expectations accelerating earnings per share way eliminate wealth effect eliminated the125 discount ratethe market interest rate used investors calculate present value expected earningsto rise think process occurring case interesting issue really gets question longerterm effect inflation model bond market showing real evidence accelerating inflation expectations short markets basically saying right wrong longterm rates going rise eventually close gap may also arguing current rates right rates personally believe one assume prevailing opinion markets question confronts us context phenomenon rate used investors discount future earnings rise necessary condition stability question facilitate rise put monetary policy issue somewhat reversed order kohn think crucial point express continue express general view goal basically move funds rate consistently point don’t know whether eventually need increase 50 basis points 75 basis points 100 basis points 125 basis points guess increase likely toward upper end range view key consideration stage make certain adopt used call “symmetry” wrong thing matter else indeed going argue 50 basis point increase say decide 50 basis points asymmetry opinion 50 basis points symmetry terrible mistake stage imply job convey markets consistent clearly acceleration126 productivity think increasing turbulence financial markets scene embarking routine incremental tightening argument 50 basis points today say argument basically twofold one general rule environment like last tightening move make going mistake know time almost invariably mistake tighten small incremental doses size mistake smaller definition secondly far importantly think latest evaluation equity premium stock market downright scary haven’t seen anything like fact use inflated earnings expectations security analysts PE ratios get extremely impressive equity premium back 1987 recall longterm rates going stock market went market ran steam far worse situation concerned aggressive process tightening crack market end severe problem instability dont know far go indeed dont know long continue tightening 25 basis points sort working hypothesis argue think terms moving every meeting move 25 basis point increments continue course unless appears getting behind curve inflation inflation expectations case raise size adjustment hand continue implement strategy began see wealth effect stabilizing andor gap supply demand beginning close unless happens remain unusual period never experienced arguing something coming particular simulation needed argument127 valid best judge wealth effect market extremely high valuation levels take action close supplydemand gap propose therefore move funds rate 25 basis points today include press release equivalent used call asymmetry full expectation moving march turns economic expansion accelerating indeed every reason suspect may policy issue view looking looking underlying inflation pressures economy become larger think move faster today think appropriate move 25 basis points issue asymmetric statementi dont remember exact language plan use express VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH “balance risks” CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN balance risks toward inflation vice chair VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH mr chairman fully support recommendation let make comments issue clearly whether nothing whether firm 25 basis points 50 basis points agree either case use balance risks language indicating concerned inflation think look reality perceived everywhere around world best central bank business highly regarded highly respected commitment price stability certainly defined speeches testimony think unquestioned anywhere style strong silent leader one moves incrementally move 25 basis points time systematic way move 50 basis pointsto continue analogy sudden strong silent leader starts beating chest show tough guy iswhat your128 conclusion believe scared frightened certainly go business normal way continuing exhibit confidence earned performance think thing contribute stabilizing economy agree fully working hypothesis series tightening moves appropriate believe background thinking feel strongly 25 basis points combined balance risks statement toward inflation concerns far right package today thank CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN president poole MR POOLE mr chairman certainly also support recommendation faced powerful real forces want allow run extent terms increasing productivity employment real income without upsetting inflationary apple cart like relate comments morning discussion yesterday trade deficit trade deficit also part real adjustment going economy fundamentally nominal phenomenon trade deficit financing capital flows coming country rate return high object policy determined real forces unusual certainly context postwar US history perhaps much back think move 25 basis points statement balance risks toward inflation exactly right way go market friend market anticipated move saw interest rates rise federal funds futures prediction market four weeks anything leaves market wondering go 50 basis points balanced risk129 statement markets likely say concluded done certainly conclusion want make market much work possible lead way help us figure correct response incoming flow information absolutely agree likely mean sequence 25 basis point increases meeting wouldn’t correct say dave stocktons famous language “as far eye see” nevertheless quite time working cooperatively market think best chance coming without big upset support recommendation 100 percent CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN president parry MR PARRY mr chairman prefer 50 basis point increase funds rate also public statement focusing heightened inflation risk future concern time period meeting next meeting march 21st quite long might suggest something make comfortable 25 basis point increase agree assess situation end month considerably data certainly data prices review data see feel time move appropriate dont see constrained fixed calendar case involves quite long interval meetings 14 years fed found telephone meetings times like useful perspective though it’s certainly one shared everyone reduce possibility get behind curve CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN option telephone conference always table always it’s needed employ obviously there130 MR PARRY well think might case time CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN markets tell us president stern MR STERN thank mr chairman support recommendation entirety seems given kind technology productivity shock real interest rates need rise extent occurred judgment need go see way accomplish raising funds rate ¼ point increase certainly acceptable go beyond aggressive principally considerations uncertainty seems uncertain future path productivity uncertain NAIRU personally uncertain whether latter useful concept uncertain implications increase real rates already occurred effects may turn think suggesting CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN president hoenig MR HOENIG mr chairman support proposal completely believe increased risk inflation think say also much favor 25 basis points several reasons first models show direction agree don’t show precision think proceed gradually secondly environment core inflation modest need recognize begin pave way higher rates thirdly imbalances remain trying take account don’t want shock system either think continuing steady path appropriate approach therefore support recommendation CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN governor meyer131 MR MEYER thank mr chairman support recommendation 25 basis point increase funds rate continue call asymmetric posture also agree likely implement series tightenings year likely appropriate make move meeting period time given uncertainties trend growth NAIRU inflation dynamics also given uncertainty impact policies financial conditions broadly think strong case gradualist approach hope able use bias announcement accompanies today’s action skillfully mean hope dont undermine view sensible expectations rise funds rate built term structure futures markets lot discussion today uncertainty structure economy inflation dynamics value humility don’t want lead discussion opposed humility laughter however think sometimes draw implication humility suggests inaction though certainly arguing mr chairman want bring us back discussion monetary growth targets seems monetary growth target regime danger inaction much less funds rate regime think consistent points president jordan making productivity growth little higher end little lower inflation somewhat limited wont much problem interest rate regime inaction dangerousand particularly dangerous expansion driven higher productivity raises real equilibrium interest rates also want comment bit discussion role wealth effect clearly important go productivity upturn wealth effect on132 consumption excess demand growth relative supply growth we’ve lot discussion number arenas declining equity premium higher equilibrium growth rate raise value equity prices A lot partial equilibrium analysis plug formula low equity premium voilàhigher equity prices makes little sense general equilibrium model model wealth effect ultimately generate increases real interest rates significantly cap diminish increase equity premiums think danger facing recently monetary policy somewhat slow tighten allowed economy operate partial equilibrium world think going see equity prices evolve general equilibrium world think one reason bit cautious gradualist want make comments perceive consensus strategy unfolding seems talking preemptive slowing economy trend growth reactive get trend growth stabilized unemployment rate point prepared reactive respond evidence higher inflation struggling issue whether appropriate strategy perhaps even optimal strategy given uncertainty output gap sensible strategy think gaps details fill obviously decide appropriate path funds rate slow economy trend also keep mind unsuccessful slowing economy trend therefore output gap rises even affect policy tighten otherwise tighten enough slow economy trend push output gap back I133 think consistent nonlinear rule discussed past uncertain output gap uncertainty whether beyond economy’s potential diminishes greatly output gap increases based best estimate potential third issue think going focus strategy aggressively move higher inflation extent weighted response increases output gap inflation rises aggressive otherwise way think get trend growth unemployment rate stabilizes assumed policy setting strategy consistent stable inflation output gap basically zero inflation begins rise respond increase inflation way ordinarily also revise estimate output gap requires aggressive response inflation otherwise case thoughts least shape views strategy going forward CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN governor ferguson MR FERGUSON thank mr chairman agree halves recommendation think reinforce markets right think right expectations secondly like others moved uncertainties talked also recognize inflation appear stage verge virulent outbreak move 25 basis points seems moderate appropriate think youre absolutely right suggesting time continue look reaction markets generally including asset markets think said yesterday134 likely underlying turbulence finally outlook sentence believe statement suggests risks balanced toward inflation obviously right one use take back things CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN president boehne MR BOEHNE agree recommendation ¼ point think need convey view tightening ahead us best guess significant amount tightening coming year may well time series tightening moves move ½ point going appropriate today think ¼ right basic product one confidenceconfidence going appropriate keep economy right path todays environment 25 basis point increase funds rate captures indicates yes know tightening appropriate going needs done neither going underreact overreact think important image strong confident central bank public deserves put confidence CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN president broaddus MR BROADDUS mr chairman pretty much bob parry tough call druthers preference go full ½ point decisive move preempt inflation expectations might either building likely build nearterm future recognize strong move particularly context need asymmetry whatever agree fully point score recognize risks big risk might get market break lead refer disorderly plunge stock market complicate situation make difficult us take kind steps need to135 take able accept ¼ point increase morning hope might call “asymmetry plus” need language also hopeand expect you’d inclined testimony far roadthat underscore intensity watching developments readiness move aggressively fact need also hope line hope board governors might consider complementary discount rate increase near future furthermore agree bob parry know intermeeting conference call always table context remarks hope watch market developments carefully signal call CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN governor gramlich MR GRAMLICH first data point talked yesterday difference tenyear bonds nominal real spread match developing synthetic yield CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN didnt colleagues end table MR GRAMLICH using chart exhibit 18 staff sends around every monday rendering certainly last month rise inflation premium kohn persuade way overstated yesterday nevertheless gone second thing like say tend agree bluebook simulations inflation targeting humble models believe likely need lot tightening real question deal today get here136 support recommendation 25 basis point move tilt implicit gradualism recognize benefits strategy im delighted thought strong silent leader laughter think make good point mr chairman economy many ways fragile things change rather abruptly past record good calling turns therefore chance overreact regard thought tilt connection roger ferguson’s working group one thing like tilt easily reversible raise rate 50 basis points discovered much reduced 25 basis points look though didn’t know 25 basis points tilt new data come indicating economy strong thought take tilt looks know looking data that’s nice advantage tilt i’m glad using situation number benefits gradualism strategy recognize support recommendation said costs gradualism strategy moving little late historical precedent think keep mind CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN president jordan MR JORDAN thank look financial markets tellingly meor maybe importantly tellingly mei see treasury yield curve upward sloping bit two years five years beyond five years it’s downward sloping corporate bond yields mortgage rates 8 percent hard pressed say wrong levels environment outlined greenbook associated expectations feel much firmer ground saying something wrong with137 market levels given secondhalf experience 534 percent real growth depending inflation measure nominal spending 712 8 percent thought didn’t add says market building kind real growth plus inflation inherited second half last year year don’t know nominal interest rates need go inflation turn adversely accelerate seems built marketplace right inflation expectations beginning rise think undesirable real rates go think nominal rates need increase front end curve though look rise rates securities maturing two years leave feeling 512 percent overnight interbank rate low consistent closing gap somewhat wisest thing taking step today think appropriate comment though question 50 basis points versus 25 basis points requires make reference discount rate time think still case movement funds rate accompanying increase discount rate interpreted lasting move opposed move funds rate alone given think 50 basis point increase funds rate discount rate change strong since consider directors’ recommendations discount rate increase appropriate environment prefer ¼ point funds rate knowing accompanied discount rate move fact oppose 50 basis point change funds rate either discount rate increase without CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN board governors meeting later vote discount rate president guynn138 MR GUYNN thank mr chairman came meeting intention inclination argue 50 basis point tightening think staff presentations heard yesterday comments made around table certainly support believe evidence mounting inflationary pressures probability inflation moving clearly increased view biggest worry consensus go 50 basis point tightening inclination slide back balanced risk statement eloquently pointed want support ¼ point tightening today balance risks side inflationary pressures guess already answered question let say really like see board consider discount rate increase think gives directors ownership policy action reinforces action taking view reasonably high probability step pace terms policy actions meetings come support recommendation CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN president moskow MR MOSKOW thank mr chairman table today’s wall street journal don’t know many people saw listed series possible fed actions today gave odds likely market reaction different scenarios we’ve talk aboutan increase funds rate 25 50 basis points tilt without last line table rate cut fed odds “as likely cubs winning world series” laughter likely market reaction “holy cow” laughter found upsetting obviously chance going lower rates today cubs fans always optimistic139 mr chairman support recommendation strongly think strategy incremental moves excellent one supporting markets right helping confirm inclinations seems clear move today jeopardize expansion also jeopardize credibility well important note outlook assumes fed funds path decidedly upward drift forecast horizon even strong upward tilt project deterioration inflation outlook regardless whether look core PCE core CPI measures mentioned yesterday inflation still going judgment increase 25 basis points going enough forecast horizon believe said thinking series moves make sure correct imbalance aggregate demand aggregate supply think it’s also important say balance risks tilted higher inflation exactly reasons explained articulately CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN president minehan MS MINEHAN thank mr chairman one thing came meeting determined end asymmetric directive whether went 25 50 basis point increase funds rate i’m glad appears going imagine people gave thought might recommend meeting thought clearly side 50 basis point move must admit i’m frequent debates much demand side equationi don’t think anybody doubts strength demandbut elements supply richly portrayed kohn’s different graphs i’m becoming much believer view potential productivity stay flat current high level to140 grow future better thought don’t know NAIRU forecast forecasts we’ve boston require great deal jiggering done try capture bit uncertainty know feel people apparently feel supply side also think interaction markets presents us series risks talked tried incorporate discussion yesterday respect buildup imbalances terms credit related rising asset values two things mind sense risk sense uncertainty economy’s actual capacity i’m comfortable move 25 basis points CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN governor kelley MR KELLEY mr chairman support recommendation reasons expressed think it’s exactly right thing want say feel good deal identification remarks president broaddus others around table CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN president mcteer MR MCTEER support parts recommendation far future concerned hope keep looking data make decisions one step time get programmed advance going CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN guess heard everybody MR BERNARD yes CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN looks though strong support increase 25 basis points balance risks statement toward concerns inflation MR BERNARD i’ll reading page 29 balance risks sentence sentence federal funds rate one vote involved encompassing “to committee’s longrun objectives price stability sustainable economic growth141 committee immediate future seeks conditions reserve markets consistent increasing federal funds rate average around 534 percent” moving balance risks sentence “against background long run goals price stability sustainable economic growth information currently available committee believes risks weighted mainly toward conditions may generate heightened inflation pressures foreseeable future” CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN call roll MR BERNARD chairman greenspan yes vice chairman mcdonough yes president broaddus yes governor ferguson yes governor gramlich yes president guynn yes president jordan yes governor kelley yes governor meyer yes president parry yes CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN i’d like adjourn FOMC meeting minutes temporarily ask board members join office subsequent review statement putting give us minutes i’m sorry let’s also coffee coffee break CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN board voted approve ¼ point increase discount rate level 5 percent floor open comments suggestions draft press release circulated VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH perfect142 SEVERAL perfect MR BOEHNE absolutely perfect mr chairman CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN including runon sentence laughter MR FERGUSON couldn’t run better CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN comments
